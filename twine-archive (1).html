</script><tw-passagedata pid="1" name="Start" tags="" position="1075,300" size="100,100">Rowan stood in line with the others, his boots scuffing the cold concrete floor of **Node-F1&#39;s processing center**. The massive base sat atop the Sierra Nevada range, its brutalist architecture carved directly into the rocky peaks. The air inside the facility was sterile, tinged faintly with oil and coolant. Overhead, bright fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows that seemed to stretch unnaturally long across the polished floor.  

He adjusted his chest rig, fingers brushing over the ammunition clips tightly packed for the **standard-issue MP5** slung across his back. Everything was in place, as it should be.

The line shuffled ahead. Recruits wearing the same **black tank tops and Federation armbands** moved in unison, their faces fixed forward, determined, or resigned. A massive station was just ahead, its spindly mechanical arms poised like a predator waiting to strike. The **barcode station**, Rowan thought. This is where they’d brand him. Permanently. The thought sent a shiver down his spine. He didn&#39;t know that free endless benefits would turn into this very moment.

He cast a glance to his right. A **combat engineer**, grizzled and indifferent, worked methodically with a handheld scanner. The green glow of the device flickered briefly as it confirmed each recruit’s mark, the faint sound of its approval after the processing. The recruits whose marks passed inspection marched forward, their necks stiff with the knowledge of what the barcode meant: **property of the Federation**, cataloged forever in the **Thunderhead Terminal** system.

Ahead of him, Rowan caught sight of the **Eradicator**. The towering figure stood sentinel near the processing station, a silent monolith of power wearing a matte black exoskeleton armor, and the combative uniform underneath. The visor of his blacked-out helmet gave no indication of where his eyes rested, but Rowan felt it. That heavy, oppressive feeling of being watched, judged, measured.  

The line moved again. Closer now. Rowan swallowed, his throat dry. His mind drifted to the stories he&#39;d heard, the pain of the imprinting, the sound of the machine as it carved into flesh. Some said it was quick, others claimed it lingered, but no one ever said it was easy. His fingers tightened involuntarily into a fist.

He couldn’t see past the line, but the noises of the **barcode machine** was unmistakable, its mechanical grind growing louder with each step forward. A young recruit ahead of him flinched as the machine’s arms darted out to press against the back of their neck. Rowan caught a glimpse of their face as they moved forward, a blank expression, but the slight twitch of their jaw betrayed the sting.  

As he stepped closer, the temperature felt colder, the air heavier. He rolled his shoulders, trying to focus. **This is it. No turning back now.** A faint, bitter laugh played in the back of his mind, there hadn’t been any turning back the moment he set foot in **Node-F1**.  

His thoughts blurred as the mechanical arms of the barcode station came into view. All around him. Rowan stared ahead, his heartbeat loud in his ears. Another recruit passed through, and the combat engineer waved Rowan forward.  

One step. Then another.

The line disappeared behind him as he faced the machine. His shoulders squared, and his jaw clenched. The arms hissed, unfolding toward him. **It was time.**  

**[[Stay Silent]]**
**[[Observe the Engineer]]**
**[[Check Your Equipment]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Stay Silent" tags="" position="1075,425" size="100,100">Rowan stood motionless, his shoulders squared, his head slightly bowed, trying to block out the oppressive noise of **Node-F1&#39;s processing chamber**. The sound was unrelenting. Nearby, voices barked orders, short and curt through the monotonous din. Rowan’s eyes stayed fixed forward, unblinking. There was nothing to say. No words would matter here.

He stepped forward, the soles of his boots pressing firmly against the line etched on the floor. The machine overlooked before him, larger up close, its skeletal arms gleaming in the harsh light. Its movements were almost surgical, and the air around it was cold, unnaturally so, as though the machine itself radiated the absence of warmth.  

&quot;Hold still.&quot; a voice came from somewhere to his left. Rowan didn’t turn to look.  

The machine buzzed as it scanned him, a pair of optical sensors glowing faintly as they adjusted to his height and position. Then, with a mechanical whir, one of its arms extended, its metallic joints clicking. Rowan felt the cold steel press against the back of his neck, just below the base of his skull.  

The hiss of the needle was sharp, like a serpent&#39;s strike. A brief, searing pain lanced through his skin as the barcode was etched into his flesh. It wasn’t agony, but it was enough to make his muscles tense involuntarily. He kept his breathing steady, forcing himself not to move. He wondered, fleetingly, what the mark looked like, a neat arrangement of black lines and numbers.  

The machine’s scanner beeped, the sound through the pounding in his ears. Processed. That’s what they called it. Rowan stepped foward, his hand instinctively brushing against the back of his neck. The skin was tender, warm, but the barcode was already there, etched permanently, a part of him now.  

He moved to the side, falling into step with the other recruits who had already been processed. There was no ceremony to it, no acknowledgment of what had just happened. But as he walked, Rowan couldn’t shake the feeling that something fundamental had changed.  

It wasn’t the pain of the imprint or even the efficiency of the machine, it was the Federation’s control. For a moment, he tried to imagine a life beyond these walls, beyond the concrete and steel of Node-F1. But the thought slipped away as quickly as it came, drowned out by the noise around him and the silent march of the recruits ahead. 

Rowan kept walking, the barcode on his neck burning of the choice, or lack of choice, that had brought him here.  

**[[Move to the Next Room]]**
**[[Look at the Eradicator]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Observe the Engineer" tags="" position="1200,425" size="100,100">Rowan watched the combat engineer with intensity that bordered on fixation. The man, his gloved hands steady as they guided the scanner over each recruit’s neck. The faint noises of the machine was a constant drone, punctuated only by the clinical *beep* that followed each successful scan. With every sound, Rowan’s unease deepened.  

There was something disturbingly mechanical about the process. Each grunt stepped forward, offered their neck like livestock in a processing line, and left with a small, glowing mark that would define them from now on. No words were exchanged. No acknowledgment of individuality.

He forced himself to keep moving, to suppress the instinctive tightening in his chest. His breath was shallow, his heartbeat loud enough in his ears that he half-wondered if anyone else could hear it.

When the grunt ahead of him stepped away, rubbing his freshly marked neck, it was Rowan’s turn. He hesitated, just for a moment, his eyes turning to the combat engineer. The man didn’t look up, his focus entirely on the glowing scanner in his hand. Rowan willing his legs to move, and stepped into place beneath the machine.  

The metal arm descended with a low hiss, its cold surface barely brushing the back of his neck. Rowan flinched despite himself. He felt the faint warmth of the scanner’s glow before he heard the soft hum of the device powering up. For a moment, time seemed to stretch unbearably thin.

The scanner’s glow shifted from yellow to green.  

*Beep.*  

Rowan felt the vibration of the sound more than he heard it. It was done. Just like that, the barcode was confirmed, the mark now seared into his skin. He stepped away from the machine, his movements stiff and automatic, like a marionette pulled by unseen strings.

The skin of his neck tingled where the barcode had been imprinted. He resisted the urge to reach up and touch it, knowing it would only draw unwanted attention. Instead, he kept his hands at his sides and moved back into line.  

When he finally dared to glance up, his eyes met the blank helmet of the **Eradicator**. 

The towering enforcer stood motionless, his massive frame an impenetrable wall of black armor. The reflective surface of his helmet revealed nothing, not his expression, not his intent, only Rowan’s own image staring back at him.

Rowan couldn’t shake the feeling that he was being weighed, measured, judged. The Eradicator tilted his head slightly, just enough to suggest an unspoken acknowledgment. Whether it was approval, disapproval, or something else entirely, Rowan couldn’t tell. He looked away quickly, his chest tightening as he fixed his eyes on the ground ahead.

As he stood there, the faint sounds of the scanner behind him continued, marking the next recruit and the one after that. But Rowan barely heard it. It carried expectation, compliance, and perhaps something darker, something Rowan didn’t dare name.  

He straightened his shoulders, forcing himself to stand tall, even as his mind churned with unease. He was marked now. Processed. No longer just Rowan.  

Just another grunt.

**[[Say Something to the Eradicator]]**
**[[Move to the Next Room]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Check Your Equipment" tags="" position="950,425" size="100,100">Rowan takes a quick moment to check his gear. His chest rig feels tight against his torso, but everything is in place, his MP5 is secure, the magazines full, and the ammunition for the day’s operations is ready. He breathes a little easier knowing that he&#39;s prepared. 

The line continues to move forward, and it’s almost his turn. He&#39;d glance over to the engineer, then to the Eradicator. The machine ahead is a blur of metallic limbs, waiting for him. His mind races with the thought of being marked, of what that barcode will mean for him.

Before he can think too long on it, the grunt ahead of him steps up. The machine moves quickly. The scanner beeps, confirming the process. He is next.

He&#39;d take a deep breath and step forward.

**[[Accept]]**
**[[Refuse]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Move to the Next Room" tags="" position="1075,675" size="100,100">The chamber they entered was immense, more factory than training hall, its sheer size overwhelming. Bright white lights stretched in perfect grids overhead, their sterile glow spilling down onto the dozens of recruits who moved like a tide across the cavernous space.

Rowan couldn’t help but feel like cattle, herded into an unforgiving process he barely understood. Around him, other grunts shared the same hollow stare: faces pale, movements mechanical.

The floor was marked in bright white lines, clean and perfect, dividing the room into neat formation squares. Staff sergeants paced up and down, giving orders like machine-gun fire. 

“**Move it! Faster! Find your marks!**”

Rowan kept his head down and fell into line as directed, wedged near the far-left corner of the chamber. His square filled quickly with other recruits, some barely older than him, others older but no less nervous. Everyone avoided eye contact, staring blankly ahead. Rowan was only 21 years old at this time, he coudn&#39;t shake the feeling anybody here being younger than him here.  

Then, from the far end of the room, a stage rose above the formations, a platform designed to command attention. A man stepped onto it. He was tall, his combat fatigues pristine, the black of his boots polished to a mirror finish. Rowan tensed as he strode to the center, before he stopped and gripped a microphone.  

“**Attention, recruits!**”  

His voice boomed, amplified by unseen speakers. It rolled over the crowd like a wave, drowning out every sound. Rowan swallowed hard.  

“**You’ve been chosen, not because you’re exceptional, but because you’re needed. Each of you is a cog in the great machine of the United Federation. And like any machine, we demand efficiency, loyalty, and discipline.**”  

“**Some of you were drafted because you lacked direction. Others because you sought purpose. And a few of you—**” his lip curled in disdain, “**—because you dared to defy the Federation.**”  

“**But let me be clear: what brought you here no longer matters. What matters now is what you will become.**”

“**The Federation has promised you purpose, stability, and protection. For some, that will mean pride in service. For others, redemption. But hear me now, comfort must be earned. None of you are ready. Not yet. But we will make you ready.**”  

“**This is not a charity. This is not a game. You are property of the Federation now, and your life will be shaped by its needs. If you survive, you will earn your place in history. If you fail, you will become a lesson for others.**”  

Rowan’s stomach churned at the finality in his words. He was serious. Deadly serious.  

Then his eye swept over his group. For a moment, he could’ve sworn he looked right at him.  

“**These datapads will dictate your first assignments. Each square has been designated for specific operations. Some of you will assist with infrastructure. Others will aid in maintaining federal order.**”  

He paused and turned, pointing a gloved hand directly at Rowan’s group.  

“**And you—**”

Rowan’s breath caught.  

“**—will be tasked with assisting a designated team with gang suppression efforts in the lower districts of Vindicta City.**”  

Unease moved through the square. Rowan’s heart dropped into his stomach at the name. **Vindicta City.** He’d heard of it, a mega city where neon lights masked constant violence and corruption.

“**You will deploy to Vindicta City as support personnel. You will patrol, assist federal soldiers, and, most importantly, remind the civilians there who holds power. This is not a glamorous assignment. It is a critical one. If you succeed, you may earn a better placement. If you fail…**”  

His lips curling ever so slightly into a cruel smirk.  

“**…you won’t return to this hall.**”  

Vindicta City. They were being sent straight into hell.  

A staff sergeant emerged from the side of the stage, datapads in hand.

“**Datapads out! Memorize your deployment orders and prepare to move. Vindicta City doesn’t wait, and neither does the Federation.**”  

Rowan grabbed the slim, metallic datapad handed to him, its smooth surface cold to the touch. The screen flickered to life, displaying a grim dossier: sector designations, deployment schedules, and a breakdown of the gangs that plagued the city.

“**Fifteen minutes to transport! Pack light and move fast!**” the sergeant barked again. “**Gear up and report to the boarding zone. You’re Federation property now, and property doesn’t get breaks. Move out!**”  

**[[Review the Datapad]]**
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Look at the Eradicator" tags="" position="1200,550" size="100,100">Rowan can’t help but glance at the Eradicator. And for a moment, it feels like time slows. Their mechanical exoskeleton hums softly as they shift their weight, the faintest twitch of their head signaling that they noticed him.

A cold chill runs down Rowans spine as he lock eyes with the eradicator. Without a word, the Eradicator’s gloved hand moves swiftly to the weapon at their side, a 1010X pulse shotgun. The weapon is drawn in an instant, the barrel aimed directly at his head. The metallic click of the shotgun sends a shockwave of fear through his chest.

Their voice is a low growl. Their posture is rigid, threatening, every inch of their form demanding compliance.  

### &quot;LOOK FORWARD!&quot;

The other grunts around Rowan remain perfectly still, their eyes fixed on the ground or ahead, avoiding any chance of drawing attention. No one wants to be next. Not after that.

The Eradicator doesn’t flinch, their shotgun still trained on him. Every muscle in his body tenses, every nerve screaming at Rowan to comply. Their helmet never leaves his face, the light in it like a predator&#39;s eye, waiting for him to make the wrong move.

**[[Move to the Next Room]]**
**[[Stand Your Ground]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Say Something to the Eradicator" tags="" position="1325,550" size="100,100">“Excuse me, sir. I have a question.”  

The air seemed to freeze. Conversations and idle shuffling around him ceased as if the world collectively held its breath. Slowly, the Eradicator turned.

The Eradicator’s helmet dipped slightly, its visor a reflective void that swallowed Rowan’s image. A distorted, mechanical voice rolled out, flat yet laced with an artificial edge meant to evoke something akin to anger.  

“**You dare speak out of turn, grunt?**”  

The voice didn’t belong to a man, it belonged to the machine, a modulation of disdain. His armored boots clanged against the floor as he stepped closer, his massive frame towering over Rowan like a shadow ready to consume him.  

“**You speak, and you invite punishment. I do not answer questions. I do not explain. I enforce. That is my purpose. Do you understand me?**”  

The small whine of his 1010X shotgun changing in his grip felt quiet like a warning bell. Rowan swallowed hard, the taste of fear bitter on his tongue. He nodded quickly, desperate to convey his understanding without words.  

For a moment, the Eradicator didn’t move, as if savoring the tension. Then, with a faint click, the towering figure straightened.  

“**Ask another question, and I will end your processing. Permanently.**”  

The final word hit like a hammer. The Eradicator turned, his attention elsewhere as though Rowan was no longer worth his notice. Around him, the line began to proceed once more.  

Rowan remained frozen for a moment, his hands trembling faintly. He forced himself to take a breath, to move, to step back into line as though nothing had happened.  

**[[Move to the Next Room]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Accept" tags="" position="825,550" size="100,100">When Rowan’s turn arrived, the combat engineer gestured toward the machine with a curt, her visor catching the harsh glare of the overhead lights. The crimson glow of her augmented optics made her seem more mechanical than human. She didn’t speak, only tilted her head slightly, as if daring Rowan to hesitate.  

The air near the machine was colder, sterile, the faint scent of heated metal. As he positioned himself in front of the station, the apparatus seemed to come alive, its mechanical arms adjusting with a series of whirring motions. 

“Hold still, grunt. Won’t take long,” the engineer said, her voice devoid of any warmth.  

The brace clamped around Rowan’s neck with a pneumatic hiss, snug but firm, locking him in place. A soft noise emanated from the machine as its needle arm descended. The slim, surgical needle gleaming under the fluorescent lights.

Then came the sting, a intrusive pain followed by a burning sensation that spread like molten steel beneath his skin. His muscles tensed involuntarily, but he forced himself to remain still.

A low beep, signaling the completion of the mark. The brace released, retracting, leaving Rowan to take a tentative step back. He reached up instinctively to touch the fresh barcode, but the engineer spoke against Rowan.

“Don’t,” she snapped, raising her handheld scanner. She passed it over the back of Rowan’s neck. The scanner emitted a crisp beep, the green light confirming his identity.  

“UGF.NF1.ARMY.GNT.” the engineer said, her tone dispassionate as she read the designation from her device. “Designation assigned. Welcome to Node F1. Move on.”  

Rowan stepped out of the station, the stinging sensation from the barcode still fresh. It felt more than physical, like the ink had seeped into his very being. He clenched his fists, his jaw tightening as he suppressed the rising unease.  

The faint clink of metal boots announced the approach of an Eradicator. Towering over the line of recruits, his black armor gleamed under the sterile lights, segmented plates changing with his every movement. The red slits of his helmet’s optics locked onto Rowan, studying him with unnerving focus.

For a moment, Rowan thought the Eradicator would speak, but the figure simply tilted his head, as if filing away some unspoken judgment. Then, with an audible hiss, the Eradicator stepped aside.

Behind him, the next grunt was already stepping forward. The line continued as if nothing had happened, but Rowan’s neck still burned.

**[[Move to the Next Room]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Refuse" tags="" position="825,425" size="100,100">Rowan stood frozen, the cacophony of the processing line fading into a dull sound around him. The sweat on his back felt cold beneath his uniform, his muscles locked in defiance against the oppressive momentum of the queue. The grunt ahead of him had just stepped away, rubbing the freshly seared barcode on the back of his neck, a mark of servitude. Rowan’s boots felt as though they’d fused to the grated metal floor. He couldn’t take the next step. 

The combat engineer stationed by the barcode machine noticed the break in the rhythm. At first, she dismissed it, her scanner beeping steadily as she waved the next recruit forward. But when Rowan didn’t move, the sound of her device stopped, and her head turned sharply in his direction.

Her approach was methodical, the gait of someone conditioned to enforce order without hesitation. The faint red dots on the visor of her helmet shined under the fluorescent lights, casting her in an almost spectral glow. Her uniform, polished black armor interlaced with reinforced combat plating, clinked faintly as she stepped closer. She stopped within arm’s reach of Rowan. 

Rowan could see the faint hum of the Pulse SMG she cradled, its compact structure vibrating subtly with latent energy. She studied him in silence for a moment, her head tilting slightly like a predator sizing up prey. The visor concealed her expression.

“**Move up, grunt,**” she said.

Rowan’s throat tightened. He didn’t trust himself to speak, didn’t trust his legs to move. The engineer didn’t blink, didn’t even shift as the silence stretched taut. Her fingers adjusted their grip on the SMG, brushing the trigger with slowness. Then came the faint *click*, a sound that seemed to be far louder in Rowan’s ears than it should have. The safety was off.

“**You’re delaying the line, next step is simple. Move forward, or I’ll have to report your hesitation as defiance. And defiance has consequences.**”

Behind him, the queue changed uncomfortably, but no one dared to look in his direction. Each grunt kept their head forward, rigid and silent, as if proximity alone might rope them into the standoff. 

The engineer leaned in closer, her voice lowering to a whisper. “**You’ve got two choices. Step up and get the barcode, or give me a reason to test this on you.**” Her tone was more disturbingly intimate, like a mother speaking to a disobedient child. “**It’s been calibrated today. No misfires.**”

Rowan’s heart pounded in his chest, his body screaming at him to move, to comply, to fall back into the mechanical rhythm of the line. But his feet remained rooted, a rebellion so small yet so heavy it felt as though the entire facility pressed down on him.

The engineer straightened slightly, her tone colder now, devoid of the false patience she had offered seconds earlier. “**Last warning, grunt. Move.**”

**[[Accept]]**
**[[Stand Your Ground]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Stand Your Ground" tags="" position="1075,550" size="100,100">Rowan’s eyes were still locked onto the **Eradicator**, the towering enforcer whose presence alone could make most recruits crumble. The blackened visor of his helmet reflected Rowan’s stare, a mirror that revealed nothing but Rowan’s own defiance. Behind the Eradicator, the muzzle of a **1010X** remained steady, its cold steel barrel aimed squarely at Rowan’s skull. Still, Rowan didn’t flinch.  

His breathing stayed even, his hands clenched tightly at his sides but otherwise motionless. His feet planted firmly, his eyes unblinking. This was a test, he knew it, and he would not be the one to break.

The Eradicator’s stance changed almost imperceptibly. His armored shoulders tensed, and a low, mechanical growl escaped the voice modulator of his helmet, a sound that sent shivers down Rowan’s spine but didn’t make him look away. The giant stepped forward, the heavy thud of his boots punctuating the silence between them. For a heartbeat, Rowan thought this was it. The trigger would be pulled, and everything would end right there.  

Instead, the Eradicator made a sharp gesture across the room.  

A nearby combat engineer approached quickly, his boots clicking against the ground as he hurried to comply. The faint glow of his handheld scanner flickered as he held it up to Rowan’s neck. A single, hollow beep confirmed the barcode’s imprint. The engineer hesitated, just for a second, glancing between Rowan and the Eradicator before tapping his comms device.

His voice was quiet but urgent. **“We have a defective grunt, sir.”**  

Rowan heard the boots before he saw the officer. The recruits around him stiffened, their eyes fixed firmly to the floor as the officer approached. Rowan turned his head just slightly, enough to see him coming: wrapped in combat fatigues so clean they seemed unnatural in this place. A black beret sat squarely atop his head, adorned with the insignia of a ranking Federation Warrant Officer.

The officer stopped in front of Rowan, pulling a **stun baton** from his belt. The weapon came alive with a sharp crackle, its tip glowing a deep, menacing red. Rowan stared at the light, hypnotized by its pulse.

The officer’s voice yelled out.  

### **“ARTICLE 2.2: PREPARE FOR 3 CYCLES OF RE-EDUCATION, GRUNT!”**  

Rowan barely registered the words before the first strike came.  

The baton slammed into his side with a crackling hiss, the electric shock surging through him like wildfire. Every muscle in his body seized at once, his limbs jerking violently as the pain spread from his ribs to his fingertips. He gasped, the breath driven from his lungs, but there was no time to recover.  

The second blow came harder, driving into his chest with enough force to make his vision blur. Pain exploded through his torso, sharp and white-hot, as though the very air around him was electrified. His knees buckled slightly, but he forced himself to stay upright, teeth gritted, breath ragged.

The third strike came low, slamming into his legs and taking him off his feet completely. Rowan hit the ground hard, his knees scraping against the concrete as he crumpled forward. His hands shot out to catch himself, but the residual shock made his fingers curl uselessly. He was barely aware of the officer stepping closer, the baton arcing down.  

Another strike to his back.  

Another across his shoulder.  

The officer moved, delivering each blow. Rowan’s body twitched involuntarily with every impact, his nerves screaming in agony. By the seventh hit, he was barely conscious of where the pain was coming from. The eighth sent fresh agony through his ribs, and the ninth, a savage strike to his stomach, emptied his lungs completely.  

Rowan crumpled to the ground in a heap, his chest heaving as he tried to suck in air that wouldn’t come. His ears rang with the residual hum of the baton, his vision flickering between light and dark. He didn’t resist when two combat engineers grabbed him roughly under the arms, hauling him upright like a discarded sack of equipment.  

The officer looked over him.

**“Get back in line, Grunt. You’re lucky it’s only 3 cycles today. If you try that again, you’ll wish you hadn’t. Next time, it’s not re-education. It’s something worse.”**  

The engineers dragged Rowan forward before shoving him unceremoniously back into place. His legs trembled beneath him, every muscle still spasming faintly from the shocks, but he forced himself to stand. To straighten his back. To keep his head up.  

Around him, the other recruits didn’t move. Didn’t look. They kept their eyes fixed forward, their shoulders tense, as though they feared the mere act of acknowledging Rowan’s punishment would make them next.

Rowan swallowed hard, his throat dry and raw, and stared blankly ahead. His body ached, his vision swam, but he didn’t break. Couldn’t break.  

Somewhere behind him, the noises of the barcode machine started up again, its mechanical arm descending to mark the next recruit. Rowan stayed in line.

&lt;!-- Death Screen Passage: YOU DIED! --&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pain radiates through his body as you struggle to stand upright in the line. The officer’s taunting words, his smug expression fueling Rowans anger. The glow of their stun baton still lingers in his vision, and every fiber of Rowans being screams for retribution.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;He glances around quickly. The other grunts remain still, heads forward, refusing to acknowledge his presence. His breathing is ragged, vision swimming, but his fists clench tightly. Enough is enough. He won’t let them do this to him, or anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;With a burst of energy, he&#39;d lunge forward, aiming to grab the officer&#39;s baton. They stumble slightly, clearly caught off guard, but before Rowan can land a blow, a sharp mechanical voice can be heard across the room.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The sound of footsteps behind Rowan makes his blood run cold. Before he can react a mocking laugh cuts through the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Lethal force authorized.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A combat engineer standing nearby moves, their Pulse SMG already raised. The barrel levels with Rowans head, and in a split second, the weapon fires, a single pulse round leaves the chamber, striking him directly in the temple &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;His world goes dark instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

[[Quit Reviewing]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Quit Reviewing" tags="" position="1075,1300" size="100,100">Rowan&#39;s fingers trace the edge of his datapad, but his mind is elsewhere. The flood of information that had been coming through is just background noise now. The dropship’s engines fills his ears, vibrating through the metal walls that enclose the cargo hold. The air inside is stale, filtered, but it&#39;s colder than he expected, and the recycled oxygen does little to clear the fog in his mind. His lungs kind of burn from the lack of real air, the smell of sterilized oxygen mixing with the scent of sweat and anxiety. The hold feels claustrophobic, as if the walls are closing in with each second.

He takes a step forward, barely noticing the others as they move through the cramped space. The low buzz of the engines rattles his teeth. His fellow grunts are already packed in, all business, all silent. Black tank tops, the same armbands with the Federation seal. Each one checks and rechecks their gear, smgs meticulously locked into place. No one speaks. No one looks at each other for too long. 

Rowan glances around, catching the eye of one of the other grunts. The look is brief, impersonal, and it’s gone before he can even analyze it. There’s nothing here but duty, and that’s exactly how it’s supposed to be. No room for distractions.

The corporal near the hatch taps on the dropship controls, his face lit up by the faint green glow of the console. He doesn’t seem to be paying attention, as if this is just another routine mission. The sergeant stands near a crate of ammo, her arms folded in front of her. Her eyes sweep the room, scanning each member of the squad, ensuring everything is in order. You never have to ask her what to do, she’ll tell you, whether you want it or not.

The dropship shudders as it starts to ascend, the sound of the engines intensifying as the craft lifts off. The countdown to the drop has begun, and with it, the mission. There’s no turning back. There’s no room for hesitation.

The sergeant came forward as she approaches the comms panel. Her fingers move over the controls, inputting commands. The soft crack of static fills the hold before her voice comes through.

&quot;Overwatch, we’re moving into the area of effect. Keep sightlines open and sound on. Full support if the situation turns code burnout.&quot;

Her eyes narrow as she waits for a response, her fingers tapping against the panel impatiently. The response cracks back through the comms, distorted, but clear enough to be understood. The urgency in the sergeant’s posture doesn’t relax. Rowan watches her closely, noting the precise movements, the way she always seems in control.

&quot;You all know the drill. We secure the zone, clear any hostiles, and follow orders to the letter. No screw-ups. Got it? Those are our orders. Skeet has a hold on the lower districts. If we find him we kill him.&quot;

A few nods, a few glances toward the floor, but no one dares to speak louder than a breath. Everyone is already focused on their roles, checking weapons and equipment, mentally preparing for what’s next.

&quot;Eyes forward. We move as one. No stragglers. You hear a shot, you hit the ground and return fire. Simple as that.&quot;

The dropship rocks again, this time more violently as the exterior lights dim. The pressure in the hold rises, thick and heavy, and Rowan’s pulse quickens. 

### (text-colour:yellow)[Time Skip: 30 Minute Drop Off]

The door is about to open, and with it, the world outside. His gear feels heavier now. The straps of his chest rig dig into his shoulders, a reminder of how tightly everything is bound together.

The engines fades for a moment, replaced by the sound of the hydraulics releasing. The dropship’s doors slide open. The ground below is a blur of dark shapes, a patchwork of buildings and roads and scattered debris. There’s no time to think. 

The moment the doors open, everyone fans out, weapons raised, scanning the perimeter. The dropship hovers just long enough for them to deploy, and then, without ceremony, it lifts off again, leaving the squad behind. Rowan’s boots hit the ground with a thud. The dust from the landing stirs around him as he kneels into position, his rifle at the ready. The zone is theirs, for the moment.

Vindicta City. The target is clear: gang control. But the real question is whether or not they’ll leave alive. This squad? They’re his team. For better or worse, they have to stick together. No matter what happens next.

The distant cityscape stretches before him, a strange quiet settling over the deserted streets.

Rowan keeps his pace steady, following the corporal who leads the squad. Their rifle is held loosely in their hands, but their eyes sweeps constantly. There’s no sense of urgency in the corporal’s movements. He’s calm, almost too calm. A seasoned veteran who knows better than to rush.

Behind Rowan, the sergeant, her steps quiet. She’s at the rear of the squad, keeping the team in check, watching for any signs of complacency. Rowan can feel her eyes constantly looking from side to side.

As the squad moves through the city’s abandoned streets, there’s an eerie calm to it all. The grunts around Rowan seem absorbed in their own thoughts, silently running drills through their heads. There’s no chatter, no idle conversation. Just the sound of boots.

“You good?” The corporal asks, his eyes looking briefly over his shoulder to look at Rowan.

Rowan nods. The place feels wrong, like it’s a ticking time bomb waiting to go off. The quiet is suffocating. It&#39;s almost too quiet. The streets are littered with debris, the city’s decay in every corner. As they pass, Rowan notices the flicker of an old holographic ad on the wall, half burnt out, the faded image of a forgotten brand flashing in and out of existence.

Rowan’s eyes dart briefly to the other grunts around him. He catches sight of one in particular, a grunt with dark curly hair tied back in a bun. But what catches Rowan’s eye is the intricate cyberware lining her arms and face. The glimmer of metal beneath her skin is subtle, almost like it’s part of her, but it’s clear she’s been augmented. Her arms shimmer with faint circuitry, and the lines of her face carry the same, almost delicate, metallic pattern. Her eyes look for a moment, glancing at Rowan, and their eyes meet.

His heart skips a beat, and for a second, he can’t help but notice how pretty she is, how strange and beautiful her mix of cyberware and flesh looks. It’s almost like the cybernetics are enhancing her, making her seem even more... alive. There&#39;s something about her, something Rowan can’t quite put his finger on. Perhaps she was just too pretty to be fighting a war.

But he quickly looks away, his self-confidence all but evaporated. He had wanted to say something, to compliment her, but the thought of doing so paralyzes him. What if it comes off wrong? What if the sergeant hears? What if he’s reported for it? The thought of the consequences, Cycles, Pain. Possibly even worse. It’s safer to just keep his thoughts to himself.

Instead, Rowan focuses on the task at hand, reminding himself to stay alert. The city doesn’t forgive mistakes. As they round another corner, the corporal motions for them to stop, his hand rising sharply in a signal that commands instant obedience.

The sergeant’s voice cracks through the comms. “We’re moving in. Secure the area. Stay in formation.”

The squad halts, falling into a tighter formation. Rowan’s grip tightens on his MP5, the tension settling into his bones. It’s not just a routine patrol anymore. Something’s off. He can feel it. The adrenaline begins to trickle in, the anticipation hanging thick in the air as the squad prepares for what comes next. Whatever it is, it’s about to get real.

[[Proceed Around Corner]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Proceed Around Corner" tags="" position="1075,1425" size="100,100">The corporal’s hand shot up in a clenched fist, halting them mid-step. Rowan froze, his MP5 tight against his chest. His heart raced, not with fear, but with a strange, anticipatory thrill.

Ahead, the Sergeant stepped in. Her voice came through clear and low over the squad’s comms.  

“**Squad Alpha proceeding. Eyes up. Overwatch, confirm no movement in sightlines.**” 

Her calm authority was magnetic, Rowan thought, almost intoxicating. He couldn’t help but notice the way she held herself, poised, confident, utterly in control. The kind of leader anyone would want to follow, anyone would want to impress.   

Another sound, a soft scrape, like the drag of a boot against loose gravel, pierced the silence. This time, it was closer. Too close. The corporal pivoted, his face taut with focus, and gestured toward the deeper end of the alley where the shadows seemed to writhe. His finger jabbed toward Rowan and the grunt beside him. “**You two, check it out. Stay quiet.**”

Rowan’s heart leapt at the order. For a split second, he felt like a kid again, the one desperate to prove himself on the playground. He swallowed hard, nodding sharply as he stepped forward. This was it, an opportunity.  

He glanced at the grunt as she moved past him. It was the same Grunt he was looking at earlier. She didn’t look directly at him, but he imagined for a moment that she had. What would she think of him? Was he already getting ahead of himself? Maybe. But if he handled this right, it wouldn’t just be about doing his job, it could be a moment to stand out. Maybe even a chance to talk to her afterward, even if just briefly.  

The other grunt muttered something under her breath, likely a curse at being singled out. Rowan barely heard her. His focus was forward now, the alley stretching out like the maw of some great beast, dark and silent except for the distant drip of water and the rustle of unseen trash.

Rowan tightened his grip on the MP5, keeping the stock snug against his shoulder. Each step felt heavier than the last. The shadows grew thicker as they advanced, swallowing them whole.  

He slowed his breathing. The grunt beside him moved with less confidence. Rowan winced at the sound, already forming a mental note to berate him later, assuming they both came out of this in one piece.

Every instinct screamed that they weren’t alone in the darkness ahead. Rowan’s thumb hovered over the safety of his weapon, ready to switch it off at the slightest hint of movement. His mind raced. If something was there, he needed to act fast. Not just for his squad or himself, though that was reason enough, but for her. Rowan was mostly alone for the most part, he thought he liked it that way, but now that he sees things differently he&#39;d rather not waste this life.

What would she say if he handled this perfectly? Would she see him as dependable? Someone worth noticing? The thought fueled his steps even as the dark seemed to press in tighter.

Ahead, the alley curved sharply, its mouth obscured by a stack of rusted crates, discarded pallets, and dumpsters. Rowan raised a hand, signaling her to halt. His voice was barely above a whisper.

“**Cover me. I’ll check the corner.**”  

The grunt hesitated, clearly uneasy, but nodded. Rowan edged forward alone, his pulse thundering in his ears. Whatever lay beyond that corner, he knew one thing for certain: this was his chance. And he wasn’t about to waste it.

[[Follow Orders and Investigate the Sound]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Follow Orders and Investigate the Sound" tags="" position="925,1625" size="100,100">Her presence beside him filled Rowan with a strange mixture of exhilaration and nerves. He tried to focus, but the thought of proving himself stayed at the forefront of his mind. 

“Something feels off here.” She whispered, her voice barely audible over the comm static.

Rowan glanced at her. She wasn’t one to spook easily, which only made the knot in his stomach tighten. “We’ll handle it,” he said, trying to sound confident, though he wasn’t sure if she believed him or if he believed himself. 

As they approached the far end of the alley, something caught Rowan’s eye, a change. He raised a hand. She responded immediately, her MP5 rising. Rowan felt a surge of pride; she trusted his instincts, even if just for a moment. Together, they crept forward, boots silent on the uneven ground.

Then it happened.

A brilliant flash of light engulfed the alley, followed by a thunderous explosion that drowned out Rowan’s thoughts. The force hit him like a freight train, throwing him backward. Pain erupted in his side as he collided with the ground, the world spinning violently. His ears rang incessantly, muffling the chaos around him. 

Through the haze, Rowan tried to push himself up, but agony shot through his leg. He looked down, heart sinking as he saw a jagged shard of metal lodged deep in his thigh. Blood seeped into his fatigues, staining them dark. Gritting his teeth, he dragged himself to a sitting position, scanning the scene. 

The grunt lays motionless a few feet away, her weapon just out of reach. Panic surged in Rowan’s chest, drowning out the pain. He clawed his way toward her, the shrapnel in his leg biting deeper with every movement. 

Before he could reach her, figures emerged from the smoke. Gang members, Skeeter Boys, their armor cobbled together from salvaged Federation gear, descended on the squad like vultures. One of them moved toward her, a machete glinting in the smoky light. 

Rowan’s hand shot to his MP5. Pain screamed through his body as he forced himself into a crouch, using the dumpster for support. His vision blurred, his pulse roaring in his ears, but his focus locked onto the machete-wielding thug.

With a burst of adrenaline, you aim your MP5, your sights locking onto the figure&#39;s chest.  

You squeeze the trigger.  

*Tat-tat-tat!*  

The gang member collapses mid-step, their weapon clattering to the ground. A ragged cheer catches in your throat as you glance back to your partner. She&#39;s alive, slumped but breathing, her bloodied figure against the wall.

&quot;Squad!&quot; a voice roars from behind the barricade. You whip your head around to see one of the privates hauling a rocket launcher off an enlisted soldier&#39;s back.

&quot;This&#39;ll clear &#39;em out!&quot; the private yells.

You realize you have mere seconds to act before the alley becomes even more chaotic. Your partner groans weakly, barely conscious. You glance between her and the encroaching chaos.

    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You press yourself against the filthy, dented dumpster, your breathing ragged as the firefight rages on. Every instinct screams at you to stay put, but the pain in your leg and the sense of abandonment eat away at you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You glance toward your squad, huddled behind a deployed barricade further down the alley. They&#39;re pinned down, too focused on returning fire to even notice you struggling.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Desperation drives you to act. You grit your teeth and drag yourself forward, one arm at a time, leaving your partner behind. You stretch your hand out, fingers trembling, as if reaching for salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Help...&quot;&lt;/em&gt; you whisper, though you know they can&#39;t hear you over the gunfire.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The sound of footsteps behind you makes your blood run cold. Before you can react, a sharp, mocking laugh cuts through the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The gang member&#39;s voice is the last thing you hear before the whirring of a pulse SMG starts. You get shot in the back of the head. The world goes black instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rowan grits his teeth against the pain shooting through your leg and push yourself toward your partner. The firefight rages around you, bullets ricochet off walls, and shouts fill the air. She lies just a few feet away, crumpled and motionless.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Hang on,&quot; dragging yourself closer. Every inch feels like a mile, the jagged shrapnel in your thigh grinding against muscle with every movement. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A bullet whizzes past your head, snapping against the dumpster you were using for cover. The gang members’ laughter through the alley... they’re enjoying this&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Finally, you reach her. Her face is pale, her eyes half-open but unseeing. “Hey, come on, we’re getting out of this.” you mutter, wrapping an arm under her shoulders and trying to lift. She doesn’t respond.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Then you hear it: the high-pitched whine of a pulse weapon charging. They learnt to crack the biolocked code, tragic. You glance up just in time to see a gang member aiming at you, a cruel grin plastered across their face. Time seems to slow. &quot;NO!&quot; you shout, instinctively shielding your partner’s lifeless body with your own. The shot rings out, a burst of blinding red light.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The impact hits you square in the chest, the searing heat of the pulse round ripping through your body. The pain is instant and overwhelming, like a wildfire exploding inside your ribs. You collapse, your partner slipping from your arms. Your vision begins to fade, the sounds of the firefight growing distant and muffled. You stare at her lifeless form one last time, before the gang member shoots her as well, NOWW shes dead. Your hand weakly reaching for her before the darkness takes over.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The gang member&#39;s voice is the last thing you hear before the whirring of a pulse SMG starts again. You get shot in the back of the head. The world goes black instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The world goes quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Cover Your Partner" tags="" position="450,1975" size="100,100">Rowan didn’t hesitate. His instincts overruled all reason as he threw himself over his partner, his body acting as a living shield between her and the incoming danger. The rocket fired with a deafening *WHOOSH*, the air itself trembling as it hurtled toward its target. Ahead, the gang reinforcements disappeared in a blinding flash of destruction. The explosion ripped through the narrow alley, sending out shockwaves that reverberated like a violent heartbeat.  

The force hit Rowan hard, but his positioning absorbed the worst of it, sparing his partner from the brunt of the blast. Shards of debris rained down around them, the acrid stench of smoke clawing at his nostrils. Distant cries filled the chaos, the panicked voices of retreating gang members fading into the background as Rowan’s focus narrowed.

He shifted his weight, feeling her fragile grip on his arm. Blood smeared across her uniform. Her breaths were shallow, each one a rasp that tugged at Rowan’s chest. He eased her back, gently propping her up against the wall, his movements steady despite the tremble in his fingers.  

&quot;You... saved me.&quot; she whispered, her voice raw, cracking under the shock and pain. Her eyes met his, wide with a mixture of gratitude and disbelief.  

&quot;Thanks,&quot; she added softly, her lips curling into the faintest semblance of a smile. &quot;I owe you one...&quot;  

Before he could find the words to respond, a familiar voice came from behind the defensive line.  

&quot;Impressive.&quot;

Rowan turned his head slightly, catching a glimpse of the sergeant’s approving nod through the smoke. He didn’t dwell on it. The priority was clear.  

His partner wincing as she adjusted herself. &quot;Trauma Team… Call for Trauma Team...&quot;  

As he knelt beside her, keeping watch for any further threats, Rowan’s eyes fixed briefly on her face. He would never admit it aloud, but in that fleeting look of trust and relief, he felt a sense of purpose far greater than the mission itself.  

[[Continue On]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Cover Yourself" tags="" position="575,1975" size="100,100">The *whoosh* of the RPG drowns out everything else as the rocket streaks toward the gang’s position. The shockwave slams into the metal, sending vibrations through your body.

Pain shoots up your leg as you press yourself against the dumpster, breathing hard. Blood trickling down your combat pants. You grit your teeth and peek out from your cover, then your heart drops.  

Larger chunks of debris from a collapsing wall have pinned her under a pile of rubble. She’s motionless, revealing blood-streaked hair beneath it.  

Dragging yourself toward her with a trail of blood behind you. But before you can reach her, the unmistakable *whir* of a Federation Medical Corps VTOL fills the air, and the repeated messages to keep away from the dropzone.

### The Medical Corps Arrives  

The sleek white and dark cyan aircraft descends, kicking up a storm of dust and ash. The VTOL’s turbines howl as the trauma team leaps out, drones follow them, unfolding mid-air with mechanical arms ready to assist.

Two medics spot you immediately. One kneels beside you, while the other scans your body with a compact medical device. The scanner emits a steady hum, and the medic grunts as it displays the results.

“Shrapnel embedded in the left thigh, minor blood loss. Prep for removal.”  

The second medic pulls out a small handheld device resembling a multitool. It buzzes faintly as they position it over your thigh, locking onto the shrapnel. 

&quot;This will sting.&quot; the medic warns, and they’re not kidding. The tool hums as it clamps onto the shrapnel and pulls it out in one smooth motion. You hiss through clenched teeth, but the medic’s already injecting a foam-like substance into the wound. It expands, sealing the injury and hardening within seconds. 

“You’re patched.” they say curtly, running another scanner to confirm.  

&quot;Wait!&quot; you rasp, pointing toward your partner. “Check her first. Please.”  

The medics don’t argue. They rush to her, their drones helping to lift the debris piece by piece. You watch as they uncover her.

When they finally pull her free, one medic kneels beside her, pressing two fingers to her neck. They shake their head. “No pulse. Severe cranial trauma from debris impact. Time of death: two minutes ago.”  

You sit there, frozen, as they continue. One of the medics pulls out a barcode scanner, holding it over the back of her neck. A soft beep follows as her ID flashes on their tablet:  

**Cpl. A. Raines**  
**Former Federal Infantry**  

“She’s a federal transfer.” the medic states, their tone clinical, almost indifferent. “Grunt status confirmed. Proceeding with declaration.”  

Another medic taps their device, and her profile appears briefly. Her face, young, even hopeful, stares back at you. Then, with a few swift commands, the profile disappears.  

&quot;Name, rank, and service history erased from the database.&quot; the medic announces. &quot;Cpl. Raines no longer exists. Disposal protocol initiated.&quot;  

You barely process their words. All you can see is her face, pale and lifeless. Her dark hair, tangled and dust-covered, frames a face that looks far too young for all this violence. She was barely older than you, and yet she was here, dragged down to grunt status.

The medics work quickly, moving her to a body bag without a second glance. To them, she’s just another casualty.  

Your stomach churns as you watch them zip the bag closed. The VTOL’s engines roar back to life as the trauma team finishes its task.  

“Soldier, you’re good to move.” one of the medics tells you, but their words barely register.  

[[Return To Squad]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Continue On" tags="" position="450,2100" size="100,100">The sharp whine of a VTOL’s thrusters pierced the smoke-choked air, its sleek, angular body descending onto the asphalt just outside of the Alley. The gust from its landing sent debris scattering, clearing a brief pocket of visibility. The Federation’s emblem, and a red cross framed in polished metallic plating.  

Out of the VTOL emerged the Medical Corps. Each figure carried a streamlined medkit secured to their back, their helmets emitting faint glows as real-time HUDs scanned the area.

The medics began to move out, weaving through the debris as their drones flitted around them. They paused only to assess injuries.  

Rowan’s head snapped toward the sergeant, whose urgent gestures directed the medics to his position. Two broke away from the group and closed in. Kneeling beside him and his partner, they activated their scanners, beams of light sweeping across both soldiers.

“Grunt’s stable,” one announced after a brief pause, nodding toward Rowan’s partner. “Thanks to him,” they added, glancing at Rowan with a faint note of approval.  

The second medic, however, focused entirely on Rowan. “He’s in rougher shape. Broken ribs, minor organ trauma. Hold still.”  

Pain flared through Rowan’s body as he adjusted his position slightly, but he obeyed without complaint. One of the medics deployed their toolkit, a compact device unfolding into a hovering drone. The machine’s mechanical arms extended, a soft blue light pulsing from its core as it scanned Rowan’s battered look.  

The medic pulled out a sleek device, its nozzle resembling the barrel of a gun, and sprayed a fine layer of nanofibers over the gash along Rowan’s side. The shimmering material adhered instantly, weaving itself into his torn tissue like living threads. The sensation was strange, neither painful nor pleasant, but Rowan could feel the pressure ease as the fibers reinforced his ribcage.  

“Nanofiber’s holding.” the medic said, nodding to their colleague.  

Next came the biofoam injection. The second medic warned him briefly, “You’re gonna feel a pinch.” Rowan gritted his teeth as the syringe pressed against his side, delivering a warmth that quickly spread through his torso. He felt the foam expand internally, sealing ruptured vessels and numbing the deep ache.  

The drone positioned a compact exo-brace over Rowan’s chest. With a quiet *click*, the brace locked into place, stabilizing his torso to prevent further strain. The relief was immediate, though the stiffness reminded Rowan of the limitations it imposed.  

Nearby, his partner received her own treatment. One of the medics affixed a round adhesive patch to the shoulder wound, the material glowing faintly as it delivered a cocktail of anesthetics and regenerative pulses. She winced briefly before relaxing.  

The medics stepped back, their scanners emitting a final confirmation beep. “Both stable,” one said, their voice brisk but tinged with reassurance. “You’ll need proper recovery time, but you’re good to move.”  

Rowan staggered to his feet, his partner leaning on him for support. She squeezed his shoulder lightly, her eyes meeting his.  

“Thanks,” she said softly, her words laden with gratitude. “Really. I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for you.”

Rowan opened his mouth to respond, but the moment was cut short by the sergeant’s voice, booming above the hum of the VTOL’s thrusters.  

“Get moving, soldiers! We’re not done yet.”  

The medics retreated, the VTOL’s enginescame to life as it prepared to ascend. Rowan tightened his grip on his partner’s arm, steadying her as they rejoined the line. There was no time to dwell on gratitude or relief; the mission wasn’t over, and the battlefield demanded their focus once more.

[[Get Back To Patrolling]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Get Back To Patrolling" tags="" position="450,2225" size="100,100">The sounds of the firefight had long faded into the background. Rowan could still feel the presence of his partner beside him.

It wasn’t until now, when the immediate danger had passed and the adrenaline had started to ebb away, that Rowan really noticed her. But it was her eyes that drew him in. They were intense, a guarded sort of eyes that didn’t let anything slip through, but there was something alive behind them. Something real.

Rowan tried to focus, his eyes focusing to the street ahead, as the reality of their situation returned to the forefront of his mind. Yet, for some reason, the more he tried to focus on the task at hand, the more his thoughts scattered. The realization hit him like a sudden wave, the woman beside him was *stunning*, and it threw him off balance in a way he wasn’t prepared for.

His mind stumbled for a moment, and before he could stop himself, he felt the heat creeping up the back of his neck. His heart picked up pace, thumping like he’d just sprinted across the battlefield. And of course, she noticed.

&quot;You good over there?&quot; Her voice was teasing, but there was a curious tone to it, as though she knew exactly what was going on.

&quot;Yeah. Fine,&quot; Rowan said, fighting to sound casual, to push away the awkwardness that threatened to overwhelm him. &quot;Just, uh, keeping my eyes open. You know how it is.&quot;

Her smirk widened, just enough to make Rowan’s chest tighten. The amusement in her eyes made it clear she knew exactly what was happening.

&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; she said, drawing out the word like she had figured him out completely. Her eyes remained on him for a moment longer, studying him, before she fixed her attention to the street ahead again.  

Rowan opened his mouth, about to say something, anything, to change the subject, but before he could, she spoke again. It was quieter this time, thoughtful.

&quot;You’re probably wondering what someone like me is doing here.&quot; The words seemed to stick between them, and Rowan glanced over at her, curiosity piqued.

He hesitated just a little, because at first he didn&#39;t really care, but curiosity and boredom got the better of him. &quot;It did cross my mind, actually. You don’t exactly scream ‘rookie.’&quot;

&quot;Trust me, I’m no special case. Just a regular federal soldier. Was, anyway.&quot;

There was something in the way she said it that made Rowan glance at her again. This time, her smirk was gone. Her eyes were fixed firmly on the road ahead.

&quot;What happened?&quot; he asked, unable to keep the concern from slipping into his voice.

She sighed deeply, the sound heavy, as though she were releasing something more than just air. &quot;Messed up,&quot; she said simply, her voice flat but laced with a quiet bitterness. &quot;Thought I could outsmart the brass. Took some shortcuts I shouldn’t have. They don’t like that, in case you hadn’t guessed. So now, here I am. Bottom of the barrel. A grunt. Guess it’s what I deserve.&quot;

Rowan didn’t know how to respond. Her words weren’t the kind of story he had expected. There was an openness to them. But even then, he could tell she wasn’t saying everything. He could see the sorrow behind her eyes, the layers that she had yet to share.

&quot;Getting thrown down to grunt status isn’t exactly a slap on the wrist,&quot; he said carefully, his voice softening. &quot;That’s… pretty serious.&quot;

She shrugged, the motion almost mechanical, as if her own past had long since made such things feel irrelevant. &quot;Yeah. Well, you screw up bad enough, they make sure you know it. But I’m still here, aren’t I? Still fighting.&quot;

She’d been through hell, and yet, she was still standing, still pushing forward. A part of him couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of admiration, but there was something else there too, something he couldn’t quite name.

&quot;And what about you?&quot; she asked, her voice light but curious. &quot;What’s your story, mystery man?&quot;

Rowan chuckled nervously, scratching the back of his neck. &quot;Nothing as exciting as yours. I was put here when they found out how fit I was... I was a hunter.&quot;

She laughed, the sound a soft, genuine thing that sent a strange flutter through him. &quot;Well, you’re doing a good job so far. Saved me back there.&quot; She nudged his shoulder playfully, the small contact sending a jolt through him. 

&quot;Just doing my job,&quot; Rowan mumbled, trying to look anywhere but at her.

Her eyesstill fixed on him, piercing and perceptive, as if she were trying to read something deep within him. Then, without warning, she spoke again, her voice softer now, tinged with something that might have been warmth.

&quot;You’re not bad, you know. For a grunt.&quot;

It was a simple comment, but the way she said it, the tiniest hint of affection behind her words, sent a strange tightness through Rowan’s chest. He looked at her, and for a moment, their eyes met, and the world around them seemed to slip away, just for the briefest of moments.

But then, just as quickly, she broke the moment with a teasing grin. &quot;Just don’t let it go to your head, hero. We’ve still got a long patrol ahead. Names Maria.&quot;

Rowan let out a nervous laugh, shaking his head as he regained his composure. &quot;Wouldn’t dream of it. I&#39;m Rowan, pleasure to be working with you.&quot;

[[Continue Ahead]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Continue Ahead" tags="" position="450,2350" size="100,100">The sergeant’s comm buzzed with static before a distorted voice broke through, warped and inhuman. It was Overwatch speaking in its cryptic code, guttural tones and clipped patterns designed to scramble even the sharpest enemy ears. The sergeant cocked her head, her brow furrowing as she parsed the garbled message.  

&quot;Fortress team under fire. Anti-Federal ambush. They’re holding, but not for long,&quot; 

The squad tensed, weapons shifting into ready positions. You glanced at your partner, but her eyes steady, she looked at you and smiled. She caught your look and gave a small nod, her unspoken &quot;stay focused&quot; enough to ground you.  

&quot;Alright, listen up. We’ve got a fortification team ahead, pinned by rioters. They’ve lost control of the crowd. That means it’s our problem now. We move fast, we move smart. No screw-ups. You’re on point. Grunts, watch your spacing. Don’t give these bastards an opening.&quot;  

As the squad advanced through the crumbling streets, the chaotic noise grew louder, angry shouts, heavy impacts, and the occasional gunshot bouncing off the cracked concrete walls.

&quot;This is where they ambush the unprepared.&quot;

Ahead, the sergeant held up a fist, signaling the squad to halt. She tilted her head, her comm crackling again as Overwatch spoke. To anyone else, it was nonsense, a mechanical symphony of garbled tones and hisses. But the sergeant understood.  

&quot;They’ve got rioters on all sides. Fortifier still holding, but their Eradicator’s running dry. We don’t have much time. Move!&quot;

You surged forward, your boots pounding the asphalt. Rounding the corner, you saw it, a glowing red shield bubble straining against the sheer mass of the crowd.  

Inside, the Fortifier stood firm, the massive generator strapped to his back sparking faintly as it held the line. Beside him, the Eradicator pumped his shotgun, firing into the swarm of rioters armed with crude weapons, nailed bats, steel pipes, anything they could get their hands on. Bodies lay strewn across the ground, the stench of blood and desperation. The Eradicator kept yelling out verdicts as they fired into the crowd, but there was too many of them.

# &quot;GET BACK!&quot;

The Fortifier turned his helmet. &quot;About damn time! Shield’s holding, but not for long. Eradicator’s almost dry. These bastards keep coming!&quot;  

[[LIGHT THEM UP.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="Return To Squad" tags="" position="575,2100" size="100,100">You lean against the side of a crumbling wall, still catching your breath as the VTOL whirs off into the distance. The pain in your leg is dulled by the foam, but the ache in your chest is something else entirely. Your sergeant approaches you.  

“I saw what happened. You held up better than I expected.”  

You glance up at her, still shaken. “The person I was posted up with... she didn’t deserve that. She looked too.. too pretty to be doing this.”  

The sergeant’s eyes narrow. “What the hell’s that supposed to mean?” she snaps, offended but not quite angry. “You think this war spares people just because they’re easy on the eyes?”  

You stammer, trying to explain. “No, it’s not that—”  

She cuts you off, shaking her head with a frustrated sigh. “Stuff happens, soldier. You think I haven’t seen this a thousand times before? People who don’t belong here, who should’ve been anywhere else but on the frontlines? And guess what? They still end up here.”  

You bite your lip, the guilt settling in heavier.

“She shouldn’t have been here.” you murmur, almost to yourself.  

The sergeant stares at you for a long moment, her expression softening just slightly. “None of us should be here.” she says, her voice quieter now. “But we are. And for the record, we weren’t expecting you to come out alive after that rocket. That was one hell of a move, covering yourself like that.”

You nod, unsure how to respond.  

“But, we don’t have time to mourn every loss out here. You hear me? Move on. Because if we sit here too long, those gang goons are gonna show up, and they won’t give us the luxury of regret.”  

She steps back, giving you a pointed look. “Can you still move, or am I dragging your sorry self to the next patrol zone?”  

“I can move.” you reply quickly, straightening up despite the dull ache in your leg.  

“Good. Then let’s go. And next time, keep your head in the fight, not on how someone looks. It’ll keep you alive longer.”  

[[&quot;Understood, Sergeant. Won’t happen again.&quot;]]
[[&quot;Can I please have a minute? That was a lot.&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="&quot;Understood, Sergeant. Won’t happen again.&quot;" tags="" position="575,2225" size="100,100">You straightened up, wincing as the sharp pain in your patched-up thigh reminded you of your earlier injury. “It won’t happen again, Sergeant.&quot;

The sergeant gave you a long look, her expression unreadable in the dim light. Then she gave a curt nod, her tone flat but approving. “Good. Learn from it. I don’t want to lose anyone else today, least of all because they can’t focus.”  

She pointed toward the rest of the squad, who were already forming up ahead, weapons ready and eyes scanning the surroundings. “Get over there. Stick close. We’re moving out now.”  

You limped toward the squad, falling into formation as the sergeant barked out a quick series of commands. Your squad is keeping tight angles and scanning every crevis for threats.  

You clutched your weapon a little tighter, eyes darting between your surroundings and the backs of your squadmates.  

[[**You had to move. You had to keep going.**]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="&quot;Can I please have a minute? That was a lot.&quot;" tags="" position="700,2225" size="100,100">The sergeant’s face hardened at your request, her tone clipped but not unkind. “I get it, kid. It was a lot. But we don’t have the luxury for ‘a minute’ right now.” She gestured down the alley, where the rest of the squad was already regrouping. “We’ve got a quota to meet, and if we fall behind, none of us are walking out of this gutter alive, or worse.”  

She placed a firm hand on your shoulder, her voice softening slightly. “You think I don’t feel it too? I do. But that’s the job. You keep moving, or this place swallows you whole. Now, on your feet. We’re leaving.”  

The sergeant shot you a meaningful look. “We don’t have time to die here. Not today.”  

Without waiting for your response, she turned and motioned for you to follow, the squad’s formation already tightening as they prepared to move out.  

[[**You had to move. You had to keep going.**]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="**You had to move. You had to keep going.**" tags="" position="700,2350" size="100,100">You kept your head down as you moved with the squad, your thoughts still lingering on the one person you couldn’t save. It didn’t matter that you did what you could, that wasn’t enough. That girl, so full of potential, so young, should still be here. The scene kept replaying in your mind. You tried pulling her out, but the blast was too close, the rubble too much. YOU survived, but she didn’t. And you couldn’t stop wondering why it wasn’t you.

&quot;Couldn’t save her...&quot; you muttered quietly under your breath, unsure if anyone was listening.

It wasn&#39;t like you could’ve known the outcome, but that didn’t make it easier. The more you thought about it, the worse it felt. The guilt, the haunting thought that you could’ve done more, but you were too slow, too unsure. 

The sound of the radio cracked to life, breaking your spiraling thoughts. Overwatch, the voice of command, was on the other end, speaking in the Federation&#39;s encrypted code, all distorted and unintelligible to anyone but the sergeant.  

The sergeant’s face tightened, her posture rigid as she listened. Her eyes never left the horizon, scanning for threats, but she responded quickly, her voice calm and composed. 

“Understood, Overwatch. We’re close. We’ll be there.”  

She released the comms button and turned to the squad.  

“Alright, listen up! Another squad needs assistance. Fortifier and Eradicator units are overrun. We’re moving in, now.”

You swallowed hard, the weight of the situation pressing on your chest. Overrun? That wasn’t just a minor skirmish. It meant trouble. And in this kind of work, trouble meant death.

[[Proceed To Location]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="Proceed To Location" tags="" position="700,2475" size="100,100">As you and the squad approached the scene, the sound of shouting and the unmistakable clattering of makeshift weapons filled the air. The tension was thick, and the atmosphere was saturated with fear and anger. The street was a chaotic mess — a horde of civilians, all wielding makeshift weapons like nailed bats and broken pipes, surged toward a defensive line. 

At the front, you could see the Fortifier — a hulking figure encased in heavy armor, projecting a red shield bubble that flickered violently as it absorbed impact from the incoming onslaught. The shield was holding, but barely. Each time a weapon collided with it, a ripple of energy surged outward, but the shield’s glow was weakening. It was a glowing, almost angry red, the color of urgency. There was no mistaking it: the Fortifier was struggling to keep the bubble intact, and if it fell, they were done. 

Beside the Fortifier stood the Eradicator unit, a combative breacher armed with a shotgun, swinging it to keep the advancing crowd at bay. Every shot fired seemed to clear a small path, but it wasn’t enough to stop the tide. The population, they weren’t gang members, but desperate, angry civilians who had no other outlet for their rage. 

You could see that some of them had already fallen, their bodies sprawled across the ground. The Fortifier’s shield had protected them so far, but there was no telling how long it would hold. The Eradicator’s shotgun blasts were slowing the crowd, but with the numbers they were facing, it seemed like just a matter of time before they would be overwhelmed.

The Fortifier’s shoulders slumped slightly as they braced against the push of the crowd, eyes flicking over to the Eradicator with a look of silent desperation. The shield was flickering more with each passing second. It could go down at any moment, and when it did, they wouldn’t be able to hold the line anymore. 

“How much longer can they hold?” one of the squad members muttered under his breath, his eyes glued to the scene ahead.

The sergeant motioned for you to keep moving forward. “We’ll find out soon enough.” 

As you drew closer, the shouts and cries from the crowd grew louder. You could see the exhaustion in the Fortifier’s movements.

[[**Shoot the Civilians**]]
[[**Demand They Isolate**]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="**Shoot the Civilians**" tags="" position="675,2600" size="100,100">The decision came swiftly. Your MP5 came up, trembling slightly in your grip before you squeezed the trigger. The shot rang out, a deafening crack that shattered the already tenuous silence. It struck one of the civilians square in the chest, and for a moment, everything froze. Then all hell broke loose. 

Your squad took your lead without hesitation. Bullets tore through the crowd, the angry shouts of defiance turning into screams of panic and pain. Some of the rioters tried to run, but it was no use, your team was relentless, cutting them down like blades through dry grass.

The Fortifier dropped the shield bubble as the last few rioters fell, revealing the aftermath of the skirmish. Dead bodies littered the street, their makeshift weapons scattered uselessly around them. Among the carnage, you saw the forms of several Federation soldiers. The bubble had protected the Fortifier and Eradicator, but the rest of their squad hadn’t been so lucky.

The Fortifier, a mountain of a soldier encased in his reinforced suit, turned to survey the scene. His shoulders slumped slightly as he glanced at the fallen Federation troops. &quot;Well.&quot; he muttered, his voice a gruff rumble through the comms, &quot;looks like the eradication team paid a steep price. Damn civvies put up more of a fight than they should’ve.&quot;

The Eradicator, shotgun still clutched tightly in his hands, nodded. &quot;They never had a chance. Neither did my team. But we finished it. That’s what matters.&quot;

Blood pooled around the bodies, their faces frozen in expressions of anger, fear, or disbelief. One of the civilians, a woman clutching a broken bat, lay slumped against a wall, her lifeless eyes staring blankly at the sky. She couldn’t have been older than 20. You swallowed hard, your throat dry.

The Fortifier clapped a massive hand on your shoulder, snapping you out of your thoughts. &quot;Good call. A tough one, but the right one. They were a threat, and now they’re not. End of story.&quot;

[[&quot;You ever think about how many people we’ve dropped like this? I know it’s &#39;for the Federation,&#39; but damn… I don’t know anymore.&quot;]]
[[&quot;Next time someone says ‘We’ll get it done in 10 minutes,’ I’m throwing them off a rooftop.&#39;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="**Demand They Isolate**" tags="" position="800,2600" size="100,100">You step forward, gun in hand, aiming toward the crowd of civilians, and shout out with authority, “Isolate!” as your squad falls into formation around you, weapons ready. The civilians pause for a moment, their eyes shifting between you and your squad. 

The Fortifier, sensing a brief opening, takes the chance to make a move. “Eradicator, reload the shredder.” The Eradicator nods without hesitation, the metallic whine of the gun shifting as it responds, “Reloading antibody cell.”

The tension rises as the civilians look back and forth, unsure of the next move. It’s only a few moments before a man, presumably the leader, steps forward from the crowd. His face is weathered, his voice hoarse, but he projects a defiance that can’t be ignored. 

“You’re fighting for the wrong side! The Federation doesn’t care about us anymore. You’re just here to enforce a system that’s long gone. Why are you enforcing their will?”

The crowd murmurs in agreement, some with eyes filled with anger, others uncertain. The Fortifier tightens his grip on his shield, the red energy flickering as the tension builds. You can feel your heart racing, knowing that if this escalates further, the situation could spiral out of control. The Eradicator shifts his stance, fingers ready to squeeze the trigger. 

[[&quot;ISOLATE!&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="&quot;ISOLATE!&quot;" tags="" position="1075,2725" size="100,100">“ISOLATE!” 

But the civilians stand their ground, not moving an inch. They’re still defiant, their anger surging, eyes flashing with resentment. 

The leader steps forward once again, raising his voice. “We want benefits! Or your equipment is ours!”

But before anything else can happen, the sound of the Eradicator finishing the reload on the shredder. His voice is cold as he announces, “Reload complete.”

The Fortifier, without hesitation, unholsters the massive weapon from his back, his red energy shield dropping as he steps forward, his voice thundering as he gives the verdict. 

“FORCING COMPLIANCE!”

The shredder whirrs to life, the devastating power of the weapon unleashing on the crowd. Muffled screams of terror fill the air as the civilians drop like flies, some trying to flee but failing to get far before the shots hit. The rest of your squad moves quickly to assist, ensuring no one escapes the wave of gunfire. 

The Fortifier and Eradicator approach your squad as the final bodies of the rioters lie still. The Fortifier nods, his voice low but filled with something you hadn’t expected respect. “Thanks for the help. You gave us the opening we needed. We were the last ones of our squad. They just came out of no where.”

The Eradicator pats you on the shoulder. “Nice distraction. Couldn’t have made it through.”

You nod in acknowledgment, feeling a strange sense of pride mixed with the grim reality of the situation. This was the job, the Federation’s orders. But in the end, it wasn’t easy to ignore the cost. Still, you can’t deny that, in this moment, you’d gained the respect of your squad.

[[&quot;You ever think about how many people we’ve dropped like this? I know it’s &#39;for the Federation,&#39; but damn… I don’t know anymore.&quot;]]

The Fortifier slung his massive shield back onto his arm and turned toward your sergeant, his tone as clipped and professional as his movements.  

&quot;We’re rolling with you. Need to link up for extraction. Lost our squad, but you’ve got room for a Fortifier, yeah?&quot;  

The sergeant, glancing at the wreckage and bodies around the Eradicator, nodded. &quot;We could use the extra cover anyway. Welcome to Alpha Team.&quot;  

“Overwatch, Fortifier Unit 4-6. Multiple loud contaminants flatlined. Fortifier and Eradicator still active. 4 Fortress Team members are flatline. Requesting status update. Joining Alpha Team.”  

A garbled, metallic reply came through, the strange voice or voices of Overwatch’s inhuman voice through the comms. Despite its unsettling tone, the Fortifier seemed unfazed.

The sergeant crossed her arms, listening to the exchange. When the Fortifier finished, she motioned for everyone to regroup. &quot;We’ve got Skeet and his boys up ahead. This isn’t just a clean-up; it’s gonna be messy. They’ve been holding down an old industrial block, abandoned for years. We’ve run into them before, scavengers turned anarchists. And guess what? They’re armed to the teeth.&quot;  

The Fortifier’s shoulders squared at the mention of the Skeeter Boys. &quot;Figures. I know exactly where their little hideout is. It’s like something out of Mad Max, rigged vehicles, makeshift weapons, the works. If we’re heading there, you’ll need me, Sergeant. That kind of chaos needs.. fortification.&quot;  

The sergeant agreed. &quot;You’re coming with us, then. You and the Eradicator are part of Alpha now.&quot;  

**[[Agree With The Mission]]**

I know it’s &#39;for the Federation,&#39; but damn… I don’t know anymore.&quot;" tags="" position="950,2725" size="100,100">&quot;This is the Lower Hand District of Vindicta,&quot; he said, gesturing at the ruined, desolate streets around you. &quot;It’s not like you’re mowing down model citizens here. This is where the scum of the city crawls to rot, the criminals, the dealers, the ones who prey on others just to scrape by. These people are trouble waiting to happen. Don’t go losing sleep over it.&quot;

&quot;This entire district is an uncontrolled pit. We’re not here to save it, we’re here to keep it from spilling over into the rest of the city. It’s not nice, not fair, but that’s the job. You think too hard about it, you’re gonna start second-guessing every pull of the trigger. That’ll get you and your squad killed faster than anything else out here.&quot;

The Eradicator, still gripping his shotgun like a lifeline, gave a small agreement. &quot;The Federation keeps the balance, one way or another. And sometimes balance is ugly.&quot;

You didn’t respond right away, your eyes are on the dead civilians across the ground. A part of you wanted to argue, to push back against the justification they were offering. But another part of you, the part that was trained to survive, knew they were right. In Vindicta, there was no room for hesitation, no room for doubt.

The sergeant gave out an order, snapping the squad back to attention. &quot;Alright, enough chatter. Form up. We’ve got a lot more work to do before this district is cleared.&quot;

The Fortifier slung his massive shield back onto his arm and turned toward your sergeant, his tone as clipped and professional as his movements.  

&quot;We’re rolling with you. Need to link up for extraction. Lost our squad, but you’ve got room for a Fortifier, yeah?&quot;  

The sergeant, glancing at the wreckage and bodies around the Eradicator, nodded. &quot;We could use the extra cover anyway. Welcome to Alpha Team.&quot;  

“Overwatch, Fortifier Unit 4-6. Multiple loud contaminants flatlined. Fortifier and Eradicator still active. 4 Fortress Team members are flatline. Requesting status update. Joining Alpha Team.”

**[[Agree With The Mission]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name="LIGHT THEM UP." tags="" position="325,2350" size="100,100">The riot was a mess of chaos, angry shouts, the clang of makeshift weapons, and the sickening thuds of bodies falling under fire. The Fortifier’s shield bubble burned a brilliant red, barely holding back the rioters pressing against it like a human tide. You and your squad took position, rifles and smgs leveled, and began firing into the crowd.  

It was controlled carnage. The rioters on your side screamed and scattered as bullets tore through them. On the far side, some dropped their weapons and started to run, the will to fight crumbling under the onslaught.  

&quot;Drop the shield!&quot; the sergeant yelled.  

The Fortifier stepped forward, massive and imposing, as the shield generator powered down. As the glowing barrier vanished, he reached back, unholstering the shredder, a heavy pulse weapon built for devastation. The sound it made as it powered up was a low, angry hum.  

&quot;ANTIBODY FORCING COMPLIANCE!&quot; 

The shredder came alive in his hands, spitting bursts of searing red light that cut through the fleeing rioters like paper. The shredder was deafening, drowning out the screams as the pulses tore into the crowd. Those who had tried to run didn’t make it far, bodies collapsed in heaps as the weapon carved through flesh and bone.  

Your partner nudged you slightly, and you glanced over at her. Her wide-eyed expression mirrored yours: a mix of horror and awe. You both looked back at the carnage unfolding before you both, barely noticing the rest of the squad cheering the Fortifier on.  

&quot;That’s how you do it, baby!&quot; one of them shouted, grinning ear to ear.  

Another added, &quot;Fortifier’s the damn MVP!&quot;  

When the last rioter dropped, the Fortifier slung the shredder over his back and turned toward your squad, stepping through the smoke and dust like some sort of armored god. His heavy footsteps crunched against the blood-soaked ground.  

&quot;Thanks for the assistance. That could’ve been us out there. My entire team’s gone, four flatlined, just me and an active Eradicator left.&quot;  

The sergeant crossed her arms. &quot;We’re just doing the job.&quot;  

The Fortifier stepped away, raising a hand to his helmet as his comm unit buzzed to life.

“Overwatch, Fortifier Unit 4-6. Multiple loud contaminants flatlined. Fortifier and Eradicator still active. 4 Fortress Team members are flatline. Requesting status update. Joining Alpha Team.”  

A garbled, metallic reply came through, the strange voice or voices of Overwatch’s inhuman voice through the comms. Despite its unsettling tone, the Fortifier seemed unfazed, nodding slightly as if decoding a complex code.

The sergeant crossed her arms, listening to the exchange. When the Fortifier finished, she motioned for everyone to regroup. &quot;We’ve got Skeet and his boys up ahead. This isn’t just a clean-up; it’s gonna be messy. They’ve been holding down an old industrial block, abandoned for years. We’ve run into them before, scavengers turned anarchists. And guess what?

The sergeant agreed. &quot;You’re coming with us, then. You and the Eradicator are part of Alpha now.&quot;  

Your partner leaned toward you, her voice low and laced with unease. &quot;Mad Max vibes? This day just keeps getting better.&quot;  

You gave her a small smirk, trying to mask your own unease. &quot;What’s a little post-apocalyptic chaos between friends, right?&quot;  

**[[Agree With Mission]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name="Agree With Mission" tags="" position="425,2475" size="100,100">The outline of Skeet’s fortress came into view. The structure was a monument to gang rule, a repurposed industrial warehouse reinforced with steel plates, jagged scrap metal, and barricades that created a foreboding perimeter. Three automated turrets perched on the roof, their rotating barrels scanning for threats. A sniper tower rose from the back corner, manned by a silhouette that occasionally shifted as the marksman adjusted their aim. Near the entrance, a handful of gang members in patched-together armor casually patrolled, their makeshift rifles slung across their backs, oblivious to the incoming assault.

The sergeant raised a hand, signaling the squad to halt. Everyone huddled close, eyes darting between her and the fortress. 

&quot;Alright, listen up. We’re going in loud. Overwatch gave the order, no sneaking, no distractions. Our job is to hit hard, clear the way, and find Skeet. No one gets out of here except us. Understood?&quot;

A murmur of acknowledgment through the squad, but your stomach tightened. The odds weren’t great. You were glancing at your partner. Her hair was down, but the slight tilt of her head toward you made it clear she’d caught your hesitation.

&quot;You good?&quot; she asked, her voice steady and calm despite the tension. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; you lied, nodding. &quot;Just… thinking.&quot;

She chuckled softly, the sound somehow reassuring in its brevity. &quot;Don’t think too much. It gets you killed. Trust me, I’ve been in worse spots than this.&quot;

Her confidence didn’t erase your fear, but it was enough to keep your legs from locking up. You couldn’t let her, or the squad down.

The sergeant’s voice snapped you out of your thoughts. &quot;Focus, grunts. Fortifier, you’re on point. We’ll cover the rear. Antibody suppression if they cluster. Let’s move!&quot;

The fortifier stepped forward, unholstering the massive pulse shredder from his back with a low mechanical hum. &quot;Activating compliance measures.&quot; he said, his tone cold and detached. He took up position in front of the squad, his massive frame a walking shield.

The first turret locked onto the squad as you emerged from cover, its barrel spinning to life. The fortifier didn’t hesitate, he raised the shredder and unleashed a barrage of pulse rounds. The turret exploded in a flash of sparks and smoke, but the sound of the gunfire alerted the entire fortress. 

&quot;Turrets engaging!&quot; someone shouted. The other two mounted guns swiveled, spewing streams of bullets that sent the squad diving for cover. The sergeant barked orders, her voice cutting through the chaos.

&quot;Suppress those turrets! Eradicator, flank left! Grunts, stay on me!&quot;

You scrambled behind a chunk of concrete, your MP5 clutched tightly in your hands. The heat of the firefight went around you, the crack of gunfire and the whine of the turrets overwhelming your senses. Your partner darted into position beside you, her movements fluid and precise despite the onslaught. 

&quot;Stay close. We push up together. Got it?&quot;

You nodded, adrenaline drowning out your fear. &quot;Got it.&quot;

The fortifier charged ahead. Pulse rounds tore into the turrets, shredding its casing until it exploded in a brilliant flash of flames and debris. But as the smoke cleared, a sharp crack rang out, a sniper had zeroed in on him from the tower.  

The impact was brutal. The fortifier staggered back, a chunk of his chest plate dented inward as the high-caliber round hit home. He stumbled, dropping to one knee as his voice came loud through the comms: **&quot;I&#39;M HIT! BODYPACK HOLDING!&quot;**  

But the situation wasn’t under control. His breathing turned ragged, and for a terrifying second, his heart flatlined. The fortifier’s shredder clattered to the ground as he slammed his fists against his chest. **&quot;C’MON, WORK!&quot;** he growled, frustration boiling over as he pounded his cybernetic body with enough force to make sparks fly from his armor.  

Every beat of his fist was desperate, the squad frozen as they watched him force his own heart to restart. Then, with a shuddering jolt, the bodypack surged back to life. The faint noise of its internal systems returning.  

The fortifier rose to his feet, towering once more. His voice back over the comms, raw and furious: **&quot;HEART’S BEATING. FORFITIER REACTIVE.&quot;** He snatched up the shredder, the weapon&#39;s hum reigniting with a menacing growl.

&quot;Sniper’s got a death wish,&quot; he snarled, raising the weapon again. Despite the pain, his massive frame moved forward, as the squad rallied behind him.

The sergeant was already moving, her rifle trained on the tower. &quot;Keep them pinned! Antibody, target the sniper!&quot;

Pulse fire ripped through the air, and the sniper ducked behind cover. The distraction gave the eradicator enough time to reach the third turret, planting a charge that detonated in a fiery blast. 

With the immediate defenses neutralized, the squad regrouped near the main entrance. Your partner patted you on the shoulder, her visor finally flipping up to reveal a small, reassuring smile.

&quot;See? Not so bad,&quot; she said, her tone lighter now.

You exhaled, the tension in your chest easing just slightly. &quot;Yeah, but we’re not inside yet.&quot;

Her expression hardened again, and she nodded. &quot;You me, the sniper up there..&quot;

**[[Bird&#39;s Nest]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="Bird&#39;s Nest" tags="" position="425,2600" size="100,100">While the fortifier and the rest of the squad unleashed chaos below, the two of you sprinted toward the tower. You reached the base first, glancing up at the rickety ladder that led to the sniper’s perch.

&quot;I’ll cover you from here,&quot; she said, keeping her weapon trained on the top of the tower. **&quot;Go. If he peeks, he’s mine.&quot;**  

You gripped the cold metal rungs as you began to climb. Every step felt like an eternity, knowing that at any moment, the sniper could pop out and take a shot.  

As you neared the top, the sniper suddenly appeared. Before you could react, he swung his boot toward you, aiming to kick you off the ladder.  

**[[Grab his leg and pull him down.]]**  
**[[Draw your sidearm and shoot him point-blank.]]**

    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As the sniper’s boot swung toward you, instinct took over. You let go of the ladder with one hand and reached for your sidearm, determined to take him out before he could strike again.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The ladder shook violently under the shift in your weight. Your grip faltered just as his boot connected with your chest, sending you hurtling backward into the void below.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The last thing you saw was her wide-eyed expression as she looked down from below, frozen in shock. The impact was immediate and unforgiving.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Your world goes dark instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="Grab his leg and pull him down." tags="" position="300,2725" size="100,100">As the sniper swung his leg to kick you off the ladder, you reacted swiftly. With a burst of adrenaline, you grabbed his boot with both hands and yanked it down with all your strength.  

The sniper lost his balance, a look of panic flashing across his face as he slipped off the edge. He fell, arms flailing, screaming all the way to the ground below. A sickening *thud* followed.

You climbed the last few rungs, pulling yourself into the sniper’s nest. The place was cramped, littered with spent casings and supplies. Propped against the wall was an **M24 Sniper Weapon System**, battered and weathered, a relic of a bygone era. It had been decommissioned decades ago but was clearly still deadly in capable hands. Next to it lay several magazines of .308 rounds.

You crouched down, inspecting the rifle. The barrel was worn but serviceable, and the scope still held a steady zero. This wasn’t just a weapon, it was an opportunity.  

**[[Use the Sniper]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="Use the Sniper" tags="" position="300,2850" size="100,100">The M24 felt cold and heavy in your hands as you adjusted it against your shoulder, the worn grip fitting almost too perfectly. Through the scope, the burnout zone below came into sharp focus. The gang members were scrambling, some taking cover behind rusted cars, others firing blindly at your squad.  

You spotted your first target, a thug with a nailed bat, giving orders. He was using a rusted barricade as cover, but not for long.  

*Boom.*  

The rifle kicked against your shoulder, and the target dropped, his body slumping over the barricade. A rush of adrenaline coursed through you as you chambered another round.

The second shot came quicker. This time, a woman aiming a pipe shotgun toward the fortifier. You fired just as she pulled the trigger.

*Boom.*  

Her body hit the ground, and the shotgun clattered uselessly to her side. Below, your squad seemed to catch the shift in momentum. The fortifier, still clutching his chest, glanced up and gave you a firm thumbs up. Even the eradicator tilted his head in a subtle show of appreciation as he went forward, shredding through the thinning gang members, using dragonbreath rounds in the AA-12. It was working!

But the rifle wasn’t perfect. As you lined up your next shot, the bolt-action jammed. You felt some frustration, fingers fumbling to unjam the mechanism. Each second felt like an eternity as you watched a gang member make a break for the manual turret. Finally, the bolt slid free.

*Boom.*  

The turret operator dropped before he could reload.  

The rifle’s quirks didn’t stop it from being *incredible*. Every shot felt purposeful. You were no longer just some grunt, you were making a difference, a sniper on high, raining justice from above. ((Not a overwatch joke by the way))

By the time you fired your last shot, the nest around you was littered with spent casings. The gang below was in shambles, their numbers decimated. The fortifier was already advancing on the remaining defenses with more confidence.  

“Damn boy” your partner’s voice crackled over the comms. You glanced down and caught her looking up at you with a grin before turning to cover the eradicator.  

The fortifier reached the last barricade, his shredder poweing up. You took one last look at the gang leader, fleeing toward the back of the fort, and considered aiming. But as the fortifier carved through the barricade and your squad charged in, it was clear, you’d already done your part.  

**[[Get Down From The Tower]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="Get Down From The Tower" tags="" position="300,2975" size="100,100">Sliding down the ladder, your boots hit the ground with a satisfying thud. The fight below was finally settling into a quiet zone. Before you could even take a breath, the sergeant’s voice was over the comms.  

“Who the hell was that up there? That was some *damn fine* shooting!”  

You glanced at your partner, unsure if you should respond. Before you could, she smirked and keyed her mic. “It was the guy who saved my life earlier. Guess he’s full of surprises.”

The fortifier gave you a quick glance and a firm nod, clearly impressed, but the eradicator? He was having the time of his life. The radio erupted with his synthetic mechanical voice just dripping with chaotic energy. 

“YOOOOO, I’M BURNIN’ EVERYTHING OUT HERE! THIS IS A DAMN BARBECUE!”  

Despite the the situation, you couldn’t help but laugh at the sheer absurdity of his tone. He was clearly enjoying himself more than he should have been. Your squadmates chuckled too, the tension breaking ever so slightly.

You wiped your hands against your tank top, the fort’s defenses were in shambles. As the fortifier and eradicator regrouped, your partner slapped you on the back.

“Nice work up there, sharpshooter. You’ve earned that grin.”

The hideout opened before you, rusted metal and crumbling concrete, with every corner brimming with gang members. They could have been anywhere, lurking behind barricades, crouched in windows, or hiding in shadows, but it didn’t matter now. You were a part of this, part of a team that had become something more than just soldiers; you were the federal fist, and the orders were simple: *kill*.

As your foot hit the crumbling concrete inside the hideout, your body surged with something beyond fear. It was the *federal rush*. Every fiber in your being screamed to fight, to destroy everything in your path. The apprehension that had clung to you earlier evaporated into adrenaline, and without a second thought, you were running toward the danger. You could feel the others hesitate for just a split second before your partner shot you a smile, the excitement of the hunt in her eyes. 

&quot;Go get &#39;em,&quot; she whispered, almost as if she knew you needed that nudge.  

You barely noticed the other grunts splitting off to cover different angles. The fortifier and eradicator were already engaging. The fortifier’s shield bubble was up. The eradicator was living for the danger, shredding through everybody with his AA-12.  

Your squadmates were taking the fight to them, but you felt a different kind of drive. This was personal. You moved quickly, the rush of battle turning your legs to steel. You heard the familiar gunfire as you pushed deeper into the hideout, but you didn’t stop. You were a grunt now, federation-trained, fed orders, and all that was left was the battle.

You rounded a corner and came face to face with a group of armed gang members, their eyes wide with panic. They didn’t even get a chance to react before you were opening fire. The *BOOM* of your MP5 was deafening, and the recoil of each shot sent a satisfying jolt through your body as bodies fell to the ground. One tried to duck behind cover, but you were faster, landing a shot that pinned them to the wall.

    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The adrenaline was pumping through your veins like fire. Every instinct screamed at you to push forward, to charge into the thick of it. Everybody knows. You didn&#39;t hesitate. You didn’t need to. This was your moment. The sound of your own heartbeat was drowned out by the pounding of gunfire, and you could barely hear your own voice.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This was pure madness, and it felt *good*. You dropped one, then another. They didn’t stand a chance. You could feel yourself grinning, the rush of combat thrilling your senses, flooding your body with excitement. The world was moving too fast for anyone to keep up, except you. You were in control. You were unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BAM!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Out of nowhere, a gang member, hulking and wild-eyed, swung a sledgehammer, the force of the strike catching you completely off-guard. The impact hit your chest with a sickening crack, sending you flying backwards before you hit the ground hard.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Your world goes dark instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="Stay back for a moment" tags="" position="425,3100" size="100,100">You held your ground at the threshold of the hideout, not rushing in like the others. Your squad barreled ahead, their weapons flashing, their voices rising. The fortifier’s shield was a moving wall, absorbing fire from every direction, while the eradicator was hammering down on anyone in their close proximity. Your partner shot you a quick glance, a silent grin flashing across her face before she darted forward with the others. 

Something about this fight felt different, this wasn’t just about brawling your way through, it was about control. You had the perfect vantage point. The others were in the thick of it, everybody knows, but you? You were free to pick your targets, to wait for the perfect shot.

You could hear the thudding footsteps of gang members, a few of them flanking from the right, others regrouping from the rear. The team was surrounded, but they didn’t realize it yet. You did. 

From your position, you could see the entirety of the battleground. The exchange of gunfire between your squad and the gang members.

**[[Use your M24]]**
**[[Let The Squad Work]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="46" name="Regroup" tags="" position="175,3100" size="100,100">It felt like the situation was dying down, your team was far from safe though. Everyone started falling back to the fortifier, who had planted himself in the middle, shield bubble raised, taking the brunt of the enemy’s fire. His massive bulk was a moving fortress, but you could see the strain in his movements, his shield flickering from the constant punishment it had absorbed.

Then, a shrill, high-pitched laugh could be heard. It was the unmistakable voice of a Skeeter Boy. You had heard rumors of their makeshift weapons, but you never expected it to hit this hard.

You looked up, just in time to see a man crouched low over the railing above, the glint of a rocket launcher. Your heart skipped a beat. The enemy was about to do something you weren’t prepared for.

&quot;Rocket!&quot; one of the grunts shouted over the comms, just as the rocket launcher came into full view. There wasn’t time for anyone to react.

The rocket slammed into the fortifier&#39;s shield, a deafening explosion that sent shockwaves through the area. The shield collapsed instantly, its energy spent. The force of the blast knocked the fortifier off his feet, and you watched in horror as the rocket shredded the air, straight into the heart of your team.

The shockwave sent debris flying, throwing you back, and the familiar voices of your comrades screamed out in agony. The blast took out one grunt, and two enlisted were caught in the explosion, their screams cut short as their bodies were shredded by the blast. The fortifier’s shield was down, and his massive frame lay in the rubble, struggling to push himself up. His armor was intact, but he was clearly dazed, struggling to regain composure.

You quickly assessed the situation. The shield generator was fried, no more cover for the team. You could hear the remaining enemy gang members laughing from above, taunting, knowing they had the upper hand for now.

**[[Rush to the fortifier’s side]]**

**[[Prioritize the Skeeter Boy with the rocket launcher]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="47" name="Use your M24" tags="" position="425,3225" size="100,100">The Skeeter gang was swarming like ants, their shouts blending with the staccato bursts of gunfire through the hideout. You exhaled slowly, lining up your next shot. One more thug went down, crumpling to the ground, his weapon clattering. 

But then, amidst the madness, movement caught your eye. A Skeeter boy, perched precariously on a makeshift platform, hefting a bulky, unmistakable tube onto his shoulder, a rocket launcher. He wasn’t aiming at you; his sights were locked on your team huddled by the Fortifier.

“Not on my watch.” you muttered under your breath, shifting your aim.

The Skeeter boy steadied himself, his finger moving to the trigger as he prepared to launch devastation into your squad. You didn’t wait. A single, precise squeeze of the trigger. The rifle cracked, and your shot found its mark. The Skeeter boy jolted backward, his body slumping lifelessly. The rocket launcher fell from his grip, clattering to the ground below, harmlessly inert.

Time seemed to slow as you watched the body hang for a second before tipping forward off the platform, hitting the ground with a dull thud. 

“Rocket boy’s down!” you called into the comms, keeping your tone steady despite the adrenaline coursing through your veins.

“Nice shot!” Her voice came through, tinged with something almost like pride. You glanced over just in time to see her flash you a quick smile before ducking behind cover again, her SMG ready to pick off the next target. 

You didn’t have time to savor the moment. The battlefield was alive with danger, but for now, you’d bought your team another breath.

Your partner, ever the opportunist, was already making her way toward the railing. She crouched low. There were a few Skeeter Boys in the vicinity, too distracted to notice her. You didn’t hesitate, covering her was your job now.

Your finger tightened on the trigger as one of the enemies glanced in her direction. He never saw it coming.

One shot, taking him out in an instant. His body crumpled to the ground, giving your partner the opening she needed to make her move.

She jumped, nimbly scaling the railing and landing in a crouch on the other side. You saw the confident smirk spread across her face as she took out another gang member, neutralizing the threat effortlessly.

She looked back at you, offering a playful wink, her eyes sparkling with that signature mix of confidence and mischief.

For a moment, you felt pride, but that’s when you noticed it, the skeeter boy creeping up behind her. A Skeeter Boy, moving silently with a knife raised high, aiming for her back.

“Wow!” you muttered to yourself. There wasn’t time to think.

You adjusted your aim in a split second. The man dropped like a puppet with its strings cut, his knife falling to the ground. 

Your partner barely flinched, but you saw her glance at the fallen body with a quiet nod of acknowledgment. This time, you couldn’t help but smirk. Honestly, she was attractive, but this wasn’t the time for distractions. You gave a brief, teasing wink back.

Yet, neither of you could afford to lose focus. The fortifier was recovering, shaking off the effects of the blast, but the damage to his shield generator had left you all exposed. They’d taken it off him entirely. The gang was down, but Skeet was still out there, and he wasn’t going down without a fight.

The moment of respite was perfect, but it was enough.

“We’re moving on,” the sergeant said through the comms. “Get ready, we’ve got one target left: Skeet. He’s ours now.”

**[[ Meet With Your Partner ]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="48" name="Let The Squad Work" tags="" position="550,3225" size="100,100">You stayed behind, watching your squad. The Fortifier led the charge with his shield, absorbing the hail of gunfire. The Eradicator let loose with bursts of dragonbreathe rounds, laughter crackling over the comms as gang members scattered. Maria held her ground.

Then it all went sideways.

A rocket streaked through the air, slamming into the Fortifier’s shield. The impact sent him sprawling back, his shield generator sparking and failing. The once-impenetrable barrier was gone.

Your chest tightened as you saw Maria alone, her cover pitifully inadequate. Before you could act, a Skeeter boy with a rusted sledgehammer charged out of the chaos, his crazed eyes locked on you.

    &lt;h1 class=&quot;you-died-text&quot;&gt;YOU DIED!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;quote-text&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, that was a quick sprint to nowhere. Maybe next time, try not to be a moving target... or, you know, just don’t run straight into a gang of people with hammers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You sprinted toward the Fortifier, your heart pounding with the thrill of the fight. The squad was taking cover, trying to recover, but you needed to get to them, needed to help hold the line.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;But as you rounded the corner, a burst of gunfire came towards YOU, and before you could even react, a sledgehammer swung at you. One of the Skeeter gang members had been lying in wait, and in an instant, the pain shot through your chest as the blow knocked the breath from your lungs.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The world around you went black as another hit came down hard, a sickening crack following it. The last thing you heard was the laughter of a gang member, and then the distant voice of your partner calling out for you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Your world goes dark instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="50" name="Prioritize the Skeeter Boy with the rocket launcher" tags="" position="300,3225" size="100,100">You locked eyes on the Skeeter Boy, his rocket launcher gleaming as he prepared to reload. There was no hesitation. You swiftly pulled out the M24 from your shoulder. You dropped to one knee, aiming down the scope.

You steadied your breathing, focusing entirely on the target. The Skeeter Boy’s focus was entirely on reloading, giving you the perfect opportunity. 

“Bang.” 

The sharp crack of your shot rang through the air, and the rocket launcher jerked out of his hands, the explosion from the launcher’s firing chamber ringing in your ears, sending the Skeeter Boy tumbling backward. The weapon fell to the ground with a heavy thud as the man went down. 

Without a second to waste, you shifted your eyes back to the battlefield, watching as the remaining Skeeter Boys scrambled. You saw the fortifier’s squad slowly regaining ground. They pulled him into cover, the massive figure grunting as his body was moved behind a nearby pillar. His armor was still intact, though his shield generator had taken a major hit, now disabled, they took it off of him. 

Your partner, ever the opportunist, was already making her way toward the railing. She crouched low. There were a few Skeeter Boys in the vicinity, too distracted to notice her. You didn’t hesitate, covering her was your job now.

**[[ Meet With Your Partner ]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="51" name=" Meet With Your Partner " tags="" position="300,3350" size="100,100">As the squad regrouped, you found yourself standing near your partner. You glanced at her, the adrenaline starting to wear off, but a small sense of calm settling in. The battle wasn’t over yet, but for now, you could breathe. 

You weren’t sure why you hadn’t asked earlier, maybe it was the heat of the moment, or the intensity of the mission, but you couldn’t help yourself now. You turned slightly toward her, feeling a bit foolish.

“Hey... Probably a bad time, but... I never got your name.”

She looked over at you, the faintest of smiles. Her eyes were warm, but there was a look to them too, as though they had seen more than most could imagine. “You don’t know my name yet? It’s Maria.” 

She offered the name as if it were the simplest thing in the world, but there was a beauty in it, a melodic quality. Maria. It rolled off her tongue like something you could listen to forever.

“What about you? What’s your name?”

You hesitated for only a second before answering, a small smile creeping onto your face. “Rowan.”

Her expression softened slightly at the sound of your name, and something twinkled in her eyes. But before either of you could say anything else, the squad called over the comms, pulling your attention back to the mission. 

“Regroup at your location. Stack up on the door. We’re breaching.”

It was time. You all crouched, weapons ready, eyes locked on the door that separated you from Skeet and whatever else lay behind it. There was no more talking, just the hum of the comms and the thud of boots against the cold, gritty floor.

“Breach!” the sergeant barked.

The door slammed open. But as your team breached, weapons raised, you froze.

There, in the center of the room, stood Skeet, but something was wrong. Skeet wasn’t alone. The room was filled with more than you expected. A dark silhouette over the scene, Void Special Forces.

&#39;&#39;It was VEGA.&#39;&#39;

And standing beside him was Astraeus, the Void operative whose very presence felt unnatural. You didn’t need to ask questions; you could see it in their faces. The squad was stunned, your breath caught in your throat as you tried to process what you were seeing.

Skeet, who had been a nightmare to everyone who crossed him, was lying crumpled on the ground. But the worst part was what was happening next.

Astraeus stood up, a sickening, smear of Skeet’s remains on his mandibles. He wiped his mouth casually, as if it were just another meal, and met your squad’s stunned looks. 

(text-colour:#ae3ec9)[“Well, looks like you made it!”] Astraeus said with a grin, his voice almost casual, as if it weren’t a room filled with blood already. (text-colour:#ae3ec9)[“Don’t worry, we’ll credit Alpha Team for the job. We’re just... hungry.”]

VEGA stood in the back, silent as ever. But he didn’t say a word. You could almost taste the confusion and frustration.

Astraeus laughed, his 6 glowing purple eyes with a bizarre sense of amusement. (text-colour:#ae3ec9)[“Flesh Feeder’s Curse,”] he said, his voice almost lighthearted. (text-colour:#ae3ec9)[“Sucks.”]

That one sentence seemed to explain everything, but it didn’t make it any easier to understand. The Void Special Forces, seemingly always one step ahead, had beaten you to the punch. They’d made their move, and taken care of business in their own way. 

Your squad was still trying to catch their breath, trying to wrap their heads around what had just happened. It felt like a surreal moment, a bitter taste in your mouth that only grew worse the longer you stared at the Void operatives standing in front of you. Skeet, the man who had terrorized so many, had been taken out not by you, but by them. 

Maria shot you a glance, her expression unreadable, but something in her eyes sparkled with a quiet understanding. You knew, in that moment, things were about to get a lot more complicated.

The sergeant, ever the professional, was the first to speak after the shock wore off. “Alright, we’re pulling out, Alpha Team can take the credit for the kill.”

But you couldn’t shake the uneasy feeling in your gut. You had just met the Void Special Forces face-to-face and it was clear now that the line between friend and foe wasn’t as clear-cut as you had thought.

As you followed the squad out, you couldn’t help but wonder, what were the Void operatives really after, and where did your team stand in the bigger picture??

        &lt;p&gt;You were aiming to grab the sledgehammer with all the James Bond action scene. You imagined yourself effortlessly disarming the gang member, taking control of the weapon, and turning the tide in one swift move.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;But the Skeeter boy was no amateur. He saw you coming and baited you, waiting for the exact moment you committed. Just as you grasped the handle of the hammer, his leg shot out, sweeping yours from under you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You crashed hard to the ground, your vision spinning. Before you could even react, the sledgehammer came down with brutal force, directly onto your ribcage. The sickening crack was in your ears as your ribs shattered, and the final blow crushed your heart.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Your world goes dark instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You fumble for your firearm, fingers fumbling for the grip, thinking you could pull off a quick shot before the Skeeter boy could react. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;By the time you had the weapon halfway drawn, the sledgehammer was already in motion. The gang member swung with terrifying force, the heavy metal slamming into your skull before you even had time to squeeze the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The impact was so violent that you were sent to the ground, your head crashing against the unforgiving concrete.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;But before the words could even fully form, the Skeeter boy with the sledgehammer was already in action. His eyes full with cruel intent as he swung the massive weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The hammer connected with your skull in a single brutal strike, silencing your call for help in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;

The Skeeter boy growled in frustration, eyes wide with rage, but you had the advantage now. The hammer was yours, and you could see the fear starting to settle in for the sledger.

        &lt;p&gt;You instinctively reached for your sidearm, your fingers brushing against the cold metal of your pistol as you prepared to end this quickly. The Skeeter boy was staggered, giving you just enough time to line up the shot. But in your haste, you forgot one crucial detail, the sledgehammer was still in your hand.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Before you could draw your weapon, the Skeeter boy grabbed the sledgehammer back with both hands. He kicked you hard in the chest, sending you to the ground, the air knocked out of your lungs. Dazed, you struggled to push yourself up, but the next thing you saw was the shadow of the hammer swinging down toward your face.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You tightened your grip on the sledgehammer, trying to wrest it away from the Skeeter boy. Every ounce of your strength went into the struggle, but the damn thing felt like it was stuck in the earth itself. You pushed with everything you had, but the sledger was quick. He shoved you hard, sending you crashing to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;As you lay there, dazed, your eyes instinctively snapped to your right. You saw your partner, caught in a firefight. She was struggling, her movements erratic as she tried to regain control of the situation. Before you could make a move, a sharp crack, she&#39;d been hit. Her body jerked in agony, and a part of you died right there with her.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Frantically, you tried to push yourself up, to regain control of the fight. But the moment you attempted to stand, the sledger lunged at you, his skull crashing into yours with bone-crushing force. The world spun, your vision blurred. Your body slumped back to the ground, and before you knew it, darkness took you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="58" name="Run Away" tags="" position="425,3475" size="100,100">You didn&#39;t think twice, and instinct kicked in. You scrambled backward. You made a break for it, retreating toward your squad. But as you ran, your thoughts were a blur. You weren&#39;t sure if you were being hunted or if your legs were just refusing to carry you.

Then, out of nowhere, there was a short burst of gunfire. The sledger stumbled, his body jerking from the force of the bullet. Your squadmate, one of the grunts, a reliable shot, had saved you. You didn&#39;t even have time to thank him. The battle was far from over, and there was no room for hesitation.

A private quickly unslung the rocket launcher from his back, and you rushed to his side. &quot;Let’s make this count,&quot; helping him load it. He nodded, focused, then fired.

The rocket blasted through the air, crashing into the makeshift platform where a cluster of Skeeter boys had been perched. The explosion was deafening, sending bodies flying. Screams filled the air as the platform crumbled under the blast, and a mass of Skeeter gang members fell to the ground, some too far gone to get back up.

You wasted no time, your MP5 was back in your hands, and the remaining Skeeters scattered like roaches. You took careful aim, picking them off one by one. There was no mercy now. Each shot brought you closer to reclaiming control. The ones who tried to run were gunned down without a second thought.

Finally, silence. The Skeeter boys who’d remained were either dead or scattered, no longer a threat.

            &lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;Skeeter Boys&lt;/span&gt; were once a horrible force, controlling the lower districts of Vindicta City. Their activities ranged from smuggling illegal weapons to extorting local businesses, and they maintained a network of spies and informants across the city.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;Known Leader:&lt;/span&gt; &quot;Skeet&quot; McGregor (alias). He was eliminated in recent operations after leading his gang into several violent encounters with Federation forces. His death has disrupted the gang’s operations significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;Lieutenant Status:&lt;/span&gt; &quot;Crank,&quot; Skeet’s trusted lieutenant, was never found after the operation. It is suspected that he either fled the area or was taken down, but his whereabouts remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The absence of their leadership has led to a temporary weakening of the gang’s structure, but remnants of the Skeeter Boys still operate in the dark, engaging in smaller scale criminal activities.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;Warning:&lt;/span&gt; Despite the loss of their leader, caution is advised. The Skeeter Boys are unpredictable, and Crank’s whereabouts are still uncertain. Their remaining members may seek revenge or attempt to reorganize under new leadership. Good job Alpha Team.&lt;/p&gt;

[[ Stop Reviewing ]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="60" name=" Stop Reviewing " tags="" position="300,3600" size="100,100"># Time Skip (Slightly)

The low hum of the dropship’s engines vibrated through the seats, and the steady rhythm of the flight only added to the sense of tired anticipation. The sergeant was busy on the comms, speaking to someone on the other end, while the corporal slumped in his seat, his eyes half-closed. His body leaned against the side of the ship like it was holding on for dear life.

But, your attention was drawn to Maria. She was sitting a little too still for someone who had just been through a firefight, her fingers absentmindedly tracing the edges of her smg. Her eyes were distant, like she was lost in thought, and you couldn’t help but feel the urge to break the silence.

You leaned forward slightly, keeping your voice low so you didn’t disturb the others. “You doing okay?” 

Maria looked up at you, a fake smile. “Yeah, just… tired, you know?”

You nodded. “I get it. Long missions have a way of wearing you down.”

She let out a small laugh but it was dry. “I didn’t think I’d make it out of this one, honestly. It’s not like I’m new to this, but every time I think I’ve figured it out, something new hits me.”

You raised an eyebrow, intrigued. “Like what?”

Maria shifted in her seat, pulling her rig tighter around herself. “I joined the UFAF for a reason. I wanted to prove something, you know? To everyone who thought I was just some..” She paused, catching herself. “Some nobody.” She looked at the ground for a second, her voice quieter now. “I thought I’d show them I wasn’t worthless.”

You studied her, noticing the way her shoulders tensed as if her words was almost too much to bear. You couldn’t just let her leave it at that.

“And did you?” you asked, your voice genuine, not prying, just curious.

She let out a long sigh, her eyes searching the dim interior of the dropship. “At first, yeah. I thought I had something to prove. But after a while, I realized I wasn’t proving anything to anyone but myself... and I still don’t feel like it’s enough. I messed up really bad. I let people die by accident. And they put me in this position. They basically told me I was worthless.”

The heaviness of her words settled between you two, and you couldn’t help but feel a pang of sympathy. You’d seen soldiers struggle with their purpose, their identity, but you hadn’t expected it to come from someone like Maria. She had always seemed so strong, so capable.

You leaned forward a little more, your tone soft. “Maria, I get it. But look at what you’ve done. You’ve proved a hell of a lot more than just that. I can’t even begin to imagine what it took to get here, but it’s clear you’re not worthless.”

She looked up at you. Then, that small smile returned, but this time it seemed more real, like it was coming from somewhere deeper. “Thanks,” she said, the words surprisingly gentle. “I don’t hear that enough.”

You smiled back, trying to shrug off that had sudden feeling on your chest. The two of you sat in silence for a moment, but it was the kind of silence that wasn’t awkward, it felt... comfortable. It was like you had just made a silent understanding between you.

The hum of the engines suddenly became louder, and you could feel the dropship beginning its descent. Maria straightened up, brushing a lock of hair behind her ear as she glanced over at you, her eyes catching yours for a moment longer than usual. 

The moment didn’t last long, though. The ship’s landing gear thudded against the surface, jolting everyone in their seats. The doors slid open with a metallic hiss, revealing the blinding lights of the processing facility. 

Immediately, you were met with the hustle and bustle of a busy base. Soldiers and officers rushed around, but your eyes couldn’t help but notice the small crowd that had gathered near the landing zone. Federal Engineers came around checking the dropship for damages in the meantime.

It wasn’t just a few faces, there were quite a few, and they were all looking at you and your squad with a mix of awe and respect. Word must have spread quickly, because the looks you and your team were getting weren’t just casual glances, they were full of recognition.

A senior officer stepped forward, his eyes locking on you as he gave a quick nod of approval. &quot;Impressive work out there, Soldier.&quot; he said, his voice clipped but sincere.

Maria shot you a look, a slight smirk forming on her face. &quot;Looks like we made quite the impression.&quot;

You couldn’t help but chuckle. &quot;Yeah, looks like it.&quot;

The officers around you exchanged brief glances, murmuring to each other. It was clear they were impressed, but there was something else in their expressions, like they were trying to size you up. You couldn’t tell if they saw potential or just an asset they could use. Either way, it was clear that this mission had put you and your squad on the map.

As you stepped off the ship and onto the tarmac, your heart raced a little faster. This wasn’t just a debrief. This was something else, something bigger. And for the first time since you joined, it felt like you were exactly where you needed to be.

Maria caught your eye once more, and for a brief second, neither of you spoke. But in that moment, there was something unspoken between you, something that you both knew, that the mission wasn’t over, not yet. 

And as the crowd around you began to disperse, you knew that things were about to change.

**[[Ceremony Sector]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="61" name="Ceremony Sector" tags="" position="300,3725" size="100,100">The hall was grander than you expected. Federation banners lined the walls, their crimson insignias against the black fabric that draped the room. Rows of soldiers stood at attention, their boots polished to a mirror shine, their expressions blank yet proud. You stood at ease, hands clasped behind your back, your squad arrayed beside you in a perfect line. Maria was at your right, her posture rigid, but you caught the way her fingers fidgeted ever so slightly against her thigh.

You stole a glance at her, and as if sensing it, she turned her head slightly. For just a moment, your eyes met, and something passed between you. There was a warmth there, a silent understanding, before you both turned back to face the stage. 

The commanding officer entered, his presence alone silencing the room. His black cloak flowed behind him, and the faint glint of his medals caught the light as he strode forward. His codename, *&quot;Taurus&quot;* was stitched in bold letters near his rank insignia, **Captain.** He swept across the room, as if he were weighing the worth of every soul present. When he reached the podium, he stopped, clasping his gloved hands behind his back.

“Today, we honor those who have struck a decisive blow against the Skeeter Boyz. Alpha Team, your actions in the field have not only eliminated a critical threat but have also sent a message to those who would dare stand against the Federation.”

The room seemed to hold its breath, every eye fixed on the Captain. “The Skeeter Boys thought themselves untouchable, their leader a symbol of defiance. But today, that symbol has been shattered. ‘Skeet’ is no more, and his followers know that the Federation does not tolerate disorder.”

Then his tone shifted, becoming more formal. “In recognition of your valor and service, Alpha Team is to be elevated in rank. But as tradition demands, you must first take the Federation Vows.”

There was a murmur of approval from the gathered soldiers. The Captain gestured, and a soldier stepped forward with a ceremonial datapad, its surface glowing faintly. He pressed a button, and the words of the vows appeared, projected in the air for all to see.

“Step forward,” the Captain commanded.

You and your squad stepped to the forefront, forming a perfect line before the stage. Maria was still beside you, and you could feel it in her as you both approached. The Captain’s piercing eyes met yours briefly, before he began.

“Repeat after me.. I swear upon my life and honor to uphold the principles of the Federation.”

(text-colour:#f03e3e)[“I swear upon my life and honor to uphold the principles of the Federation,”]

“I vow to defend its people, its laws, and its future, even at the cost of my own.”

(text-colour:#f03e3e)[“I vow to defend its people, its laws, and its future, even at the cost of my own.”]

“I renounce personal attachments that conflict with duty, be they to wealth, ambition, or… relationships.”

The words struck a chord in the room, and for a moment, you hesitated. Your voice faltered, just barely, but you repeated the vow alongside the others: (text-colour:#f03e3e)[“I renounce personal attachments that conflict with duty—be they to wealth, ambition, or… relationships.”]

The Captain’s eyes scanned the line of you, before he continued. “And finally, I commit myself to the Federation’s cause, above all else.”

(text-colour:#f03e3e)[“And finally, I commit myself to the Federation’s cause, above all else.”]

There was a brief silence as the vows concluded. Then the Captain stepped down from the podium, holding a small silver case. He approached each member of your squad, pinning medals to your uniforms. When he reached you, he paused.

“Alpha Team, you have earned this recognition,” he said, addressing the room more than you. “You are the embodiment of what it means to be Federation soldiers.”

The room erupted into applause, but you could feel the Captain’s eyes watch you for just a moment too long before he moved to Maria. After the ceremony concluded and the crowd began to disperse, you felt a hand on your shoulder. You turned to see the Captain standing close, his expression unreadable.

“Soldier, A word. In private.”

Maria glanced at you, her brow furrowed slightly, but you gave her a small nod before following the Captain out of the hall. He led you down a long corridor, the clack of his boots echoing against the polished floors. Eventually, he stopped in a small, dimly lit room, his office, you presumed. The door shut behind you, and he turned to face you.

“You handled yourself well out there,” he said, his tone measured. “You’ve proven yourself as a soldier.”

“Thank you, sir.” 

You stood at attention, heart steady but cautious. The silence stretched for a moment before he finally spoke.

“Rowan, You’ve caught my attention. Today wasn’t just about medals or ceremony. It’s about potential. Yours.”

You blinked, the words catching you off guard. “Sir?”

“I’ve been watching your performance. You’ve got instincts I rarely see. Preciseness. Focus, and discipline, though we’ll see how far that goes. The Federation needs soldiers like you.”

Before you could respond, the door opened, and an engineer stepped in unannounced, in a gray utility jumpsuit. He carried a sleek scanner that looked almost like a weapon, and without a word, he pointed it at you. The sudden movement startled you, and your hand instinctively twitched toward where your weapon would’ve been, if you weren’t unarmed.

“Stand still,” the engineer muttered, the device emitting a soft hum. 

“What the—” you began, but the Captain raised a hand, silencing you.

“Protocol,” he said calmly. “Relax.”

The scanner beeped, and a holographic display appeared in the air, showing your service records, identification, and a detailed profile. The engineer nodded, handing the Captain a smaller device connected to the scanner. The Captain studied the data with a sharp eye, his brow lifting slightly.

“So, Rowan Whitlock. Serviced during the Midwest cleansing operations. Impressive. And here…” He tapped the device, scrolling through the information. “A hunter. Is that correct?”

“Yes, sir,” you replied, trying to mask your discomfort as the engineer lingered, double-checking the scanner. “Before the servicing, I was a tracker and hunter in the northern territories.”

The Captain chuckled softly, more impressed than amused. “That explains it. Your tactics in the field, those skills don’t come from basic training. They’re honed. And it shows.”

The hologram flickered as the engineer stepped back, offering a curt nod before leaving as abruptly as he had entered. The Captain set the device down on his desk, folding his hands in front of him.

“I’m offering you a chance, Rowan. The Federation is always in need of soldiers who can lead, who can adapt, who can think. I want to enlist you for a somewhat higher position. This is a trial, an opportunity to see how far you can go.”

Your chest tightened at his words, the weight of them sinking in. “What position, sir?”

He shook his head. “That’s yet to be decided. I have options. But I’ll be watching you. You’ll hear from me soon, until then, prove to me you’re worth the investment. But you are to see the medical sector immediately and give them my card. You will be properly enlisted.”

He studied you for a moment longer, then, as if remembering something, leaned forward slightly. “One more thing. Are you married? Seeing someone?”

The question hit you like a curveball, unexpected and out of place. “No, sir,” you said, keeping your face neutral.

“Good. Relationships complicate things. They cloud judgment. And in this line of work, distractions are dangerous. Just keep that in mind.”

He straightened, gesturing toward the door. “That’ll be all for now. Dismissed.”

You saluted and exited the office. The quiet hallway felt worse than before, the Captain’s words replaying in your mind. 

As you walked back toward your squad, Maria was waiting near the exit, her brow furrowed in curiosity.

“What happened?” she asked, stepping closer.

You hesitated for a moment, considering how much to share. “Just… an opportunity,” you said finally. “We’ll see what comes of it.”

Maria raised an eyebrow but didn’t press further. Instead, she gave you a small smile. “Well, whatever it is, I’m sure you’ll handle it. You always do.”

**[[Medical Hall]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="62" name="Medical Hall" tags="" position="300,3850" size="100,100">The sterile smell of antiseptic filled the air as you stepped into the medical hall. Rows of shining metal beds and sophisticated medical equipment lined the walls. A few surgeons and medics went around, their white coats contrasting sharply with the cold, silver tones of the room. There were even some armed combat medics, they had pulse SMG&#39;s at ready, setting down injured soldiers.

As you approached the central station, one of the surgeons, a tall woman with sharp features and short black hair, noticed you. She scanned your uniform with a glance before her eyes narrowed on you.

“Grunt, What’s your business here? You’re not injured, at least, not visibly.”

You hesitated for a moment, then held out the commander’s card. She raised an eyebrow, taking it from you. Flipping it over, she scanned the barcode with a sleek handheld device. A holographic display appeared, showcasing your data alongside the Captain’s authorization.

“Well, well,” she muttered, her tone shifting slightly as she studied the display. “Looks like someone’s caught the Commander’s eye. ‘Topped up in Federal gear,’ huh? Fancy way of saying enhancements.”

Another medic, a younger man with a buzz cut and a faintly amused smirk, approached, leaning over to glance at the card. “Enhancements? For a grunt? Must’ve been a hell of a mission.”

The surgeon handed the card back, her expression unreadable. “Is this what you want?” she asked, her tone quieter but more serious now. “Because once you go under the knife, there’s no going back. The benefits are good, strength, speed, stamina, but it’s not just about the upgrades. It changes you. Sometimes in ways you don’t expect.”

The younger medic nodded. “She’s not kidding. You’ll be faster, stronger, harder to kill, but you’ll also may be different. It’s not for everyone.”

**[[“Yes, this is what I want. I’m ready to serve the Federation, no matter the cost.”]]**
**[[“I need more information before I decide.”]]**
**[[“I’m not sure. Can I refuse?”]]**

The medic smirks faintly as you pass him. “Good luck. You’re going to need it.”

You’re led into a brightly lit room where a table surrounded by robotic arms and sleek, humming equipment awaits. As you lie down, the surgeon taps a few buttons on a console, and a visor descends over your eyes. Cold, sterile air hisses around you as the machines start their work.

“We’re administering anesthesia now,” the surgeon says, her voice calm but distant. “You’ll feel a pinch and then—”

**[[Thunderhead.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="64" name="“I need more information before I decide.”" tags="" position="425,3975" size="100,100">“You’ll gain more situational awareness, Grunt. The kind that’ll make you fit for a federal soldier. The Commander wants you equipped with the very latest technology. You’ll be faster, stronger, and more capable in the field. This is the gear they want you to have upgraded and ready for anything. You’ll be equipped with it. There’s no turning back once it’s done.”

**[[“Yes, this is what I want. I’m ready to serve the Federation, no matter the cost.”]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="65" name="“I’m not sure. Can I refuse?”" tags="" position="175,3975" size="100,100">The surgeon’s expression didn’t change. She spoke with a matter-of-fact tone, as though the answer was already obvious. “You can’t refuse a direct order from a commanding officer, Grunt. Doing so would be considered insubordination. If you did refuse, you’d be recalled. Sent off to more dangerous assignments. And trust me, those aren’t the kind of missions you want to be on without the proper enhancements.” 

She gave him a hard look, her voice was very pragmatic. “This is for your own safety. And the safety of any mission.”

            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Non-essential data? Wait… is this about the commander? About whether I was seeing someone?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Are you making me forget my family? My past?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;No, this feels... wrong. I was fine before!&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;THUNDERHEAD:&lt;/span&gt; *You were weak. Hesitant. Now you are ideal.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;No! I wasn’t weak! I had something... someone. Who? No, wait... what was I talking about?*&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;ellipsis&quot;&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;THUNDERHEAD:&lt;/span&gt; *Relax. Clarity will return.*&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Purpose? What purpose?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;THUNDERHEAD:&lt;/span&gt; *To serve. To be effective. To be beyond the limits of human frailty.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;But... I had a life. I had people who mattered. Didn’t I?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;THUNDERHEAD:&lt;/span&gt; *People are irrelevant. Sentiment is obsolete. You are an asset.*&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;But I was real before! I was... me!&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;THUNDERHEAD:&lt;/span&gt; *You are still you. Just... improved.*&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;title&gt;Rowan&#39;s Passage&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rowan awoke, but there was nothing there. Nothing in the space between his thoughts, nothing in his chest. The doctors didn&#39;t say much, they never did. Just a few mumbled words about &quot;completion&quot; and &quot;adjustments,&quot; their voices fading into the sterile medical room. They were quick to turn away. Rowan didn&#39;t care, didn&#39;t feel anything about it. He stood up, now fully dressed in the federation&#39;s digital grey mixpat uniform. His body felt... foreign, like it wasn’t his. But he didn’t have the energy to question it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;He walked down the hallway, gray walls. His mind didn’t ask questions, didn’t process much beyond the directive that burned quietly in the back of his skull: Serve the Federation. His thoughts were no longer his own, only a cold voice of a life he couldn’t remember.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As he passed through the hall, he saw Maria waiting. Her eyes were red, like she&#39;d been crying. She stood in the middle of the corridor, her hands trembling, as if she wasn’t sure if she should approach. There was something about her, a look of familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&quot;Rowan…&quot; Maria’s voice tightened, her tone hesitant, almost fragile. &quot;I… I need to tell you something. I need to confess something to you, it’s—&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Rowan’s mind blinked, blanked. Her words faded into static as his eyes locked onto her. Who was she? A feeling of discomfort crawled through his chest, but it was distant, unreachable. The answer didn’t matter anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&quot;Who are you?&quot; Rowan’s voice was colder than he expected, there was nothing in them, no warmth, no recognition. Just the directive.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Maria staggered back, confusion and hurt flooding her face. &quot;Rowan… You’re messing with me, right? This isn’t you, this isn’t—&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;He didn&#39;t hear her. His look was distant. He felt no connection to her, no recognition of her face, her pain. All he saw was the insignia of the Federation. She wasn’t important. He wasn’t important.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&quot;Get back in line,&quot; Rowan ordered, his voice mechanical, distant, and firm. There was no softness left. &quot;Grunt. You belong with the rest.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Maria’s eyes widened, shock turning to confusion, but before she could say another word, he moved forward. She reached out to him, her trembling hand grabbing at his cheek, pulling him back into the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you even remember me, Rowan?&quot; Her voice was barely above a whisper, raw desperation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Rowan didn&#39;t feel her hand. He didn’t feel anything. But somehow, he knew this was important to her, this was her last attempt to cling to whatever had once been. Her hand on his cheek should have meant something, but it didn’t. All that was left was the Federation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Without thinking, Rowan grabbed her wrist and moved her hand away, gently but firmly, as though he were rearranging a misplaced object. &quot;No physical touch. Get back in line.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;He turned and walked away, leaving her standing there, frozen in confusion and heartbreak. She didn’t understand, but he didn’t care. He didn’t even know who she was anymore. All he had now was the Federation’s voice in his head, a constant hum of orders.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;He moved toward the transport sector. The hallway stretched before him like an endless tunnel, and as he approached the transport bay, he could hear the whir of the ships, the hiss of pressurized air. He stood in front of the shuttle bay, staring blankly at the doors.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;But something... something gnawed at the edges of his awareness. A shift, like a piece of his mind was trying to fight its way out from underneath the weight of the Federation&#39;s influence. But the feeling was strong, quickly replaced by the familiar, mechanical voice that guided him: Prepare for transport.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The cold, emotionless touch of the helmet awaited him.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;He stepped forward, his hand automatically reaching for the helmet on the pedestal beside him. It wasn’t just a piece of armor. It was a part of him now, a physical manifestation of his transformation. He could feel it as he lifted it. As he slipped it over his head, the world around him dulled.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;He wasn’t Rowan anymore. He was an asset, a tool. The person who had walked into this facility, confused, questioning, emotional, was gone. The helmet sealed his fate. It was complete.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Rowan wasn’t human anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;title&gt;Maria&#39;s Perspective&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maria was no longer in the room with Rowan. The words left her mouth, but she didn’t hear them. It was as though she had stepped outside of herself for a brief moment, only to realize that she had been the one speaking all along. Her eyes dropped to the ground, focusing on the place where her hand had reached for him. It wasn’t Rowan she was losing, it was herself. Or so she had thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;It didn’t hit her until the moment he turned away. She was standing there, numb. Her body wasn’t hers. Her mind was fragmented, trying to put the pieces back together. Everything felt like a dream, blurry, hollow, as though the world was suddenly too much for her to carry. The Federation had done this to her. She had lost sight of who she was, who she was supposed to be. She didn’t know if she was ever *truly* Maria anymore, or if she had become someone else, someone who followed orders.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;But there was a moment. A moment when Rowan, this boy, this stranger, had looked at her. He had seen something in her, something worth noticing. And that was everything. In that second, she knew she couldn’t let him go. The Federation’s control was suffocating, but she was *alive*, at least. She still had breath in her lungs, and it wasn’t too late to act.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Maria’s fingers clenched around the straps of her chest rig, pulling the material tight against her chest as she adjusted the fit. It wasn’t over yet. There was something in her that was reborn when she realized it wasn’t just Rowan who needed to be freed. She was too *somehow* in the moment she had been thinking of him, she realized that she was already pulling herself out of the darkness, out from under the Thunderhead’s influence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;She didn’t know how. She just felt it, an energy, an awakening. It wasn’t enough to be passive anymore. She wouldn’t wait. She wouldn’t follow blindly. She had a purpose *her own* purpose and it was clear as day. She was going to free him. She was going to free herself.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Maria took a deep breath, and with it, the tension in her body slowly loosened. It wasn’t the Federation’s voice anymore that guided her steps. It was her own. The path ahead was fraught with danger, with uncertainty, but she was done being a tool. No more following orders like a pawn. If she was to go out, she was going out with a *bang*.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;She followed behind him, keeping her distance, but not too far. Her boots moved with his, though she knew they were walking towards a precipice. She had no illusions about what might happen next. But as she watched the back of his head, his gait stiff and robotic, something inside of her screamed to reach out. She wanted to speak to him again, to tell him that she had seen the truth in him, that there was something pure, untainted, waiting to be unlocked. But she stayed quiet for now. There were no words left for him; the words were for herself.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The transport was ahead, the same sterile silence that Rowan had walked towards. She could feel the oppressiveness, the very *thing* that had suppressed her, that had forced her to live a life she didn’t recognize. But she was free now, she had set herself free. She would break him out, free him from the Federation’s claws, just like she was doing for herself unknowingly.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As they approached the shuttle bay, Maria’s grip tightened on her MP5. Her heart was pounding. She didn’t know if this was her last day, if she was going to make it through alive, but she couldn’t stop now. She wasn’t going to stop. There was nothing left to fear.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Maria watched Rowan as he boarded the shuttle, detached expression on his face. She didn’t know what had happened to him, what had stolen his soul, but she was going to fight for it. She was going to bring him back, no matter what. This was *their* fight now. No longer just his. No longer just hers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The shuttle doors slid closed, but Maria remained outside for just a moment. Her eyes reflect of herself in the glass. For the first time, she saw a *choice* in her eyes. The same reflection that had once been empty, now held something different, a light of defiance. She was free. And no matter what happened next, she wasn’t going to let anyone steal that away from her again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Got it. Civilians, possible weapons. But it’s not like a full-out war, right?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Correct. Think of it as a routine intervention. Your team will handle the situation based on the level of threat.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Alright, so who’s on my team?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*You’ll be joined by 2 grunts, a fortifier, and an eradicator. Grunts are the front-line combat units, the fortifier handles defense, and the eradicator takes care of heavy threats.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Nice, sounds like a solid team. And what’s my role here?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Focus on assessing the situation and coordinating with the team.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Got it. And this helmet... still blocking my view?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Yes, your helmet will remain obstructed until you arrive at the objective. This allows for better situational awareness once you are in position.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Fine by me. But I guess I’m going to need some visuals once we’re there?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*You will have full access to your enhanced vision once the objective is in range.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Good, good. Anything else I should know?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*No. Stay sharp, keep communication open, and be prepared for anything. The mission is simple, but never underestimate the situation.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Understood. Let’s do this!&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;ellipsis&quot;&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;section&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;I’ll take care of this. The others have my back.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Affirmative. Your team&#39;s skillset is well-matched for this operation.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;And when this is all done, what’s next?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Complete the objective, and you’ll receive further orders based on the situation.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Sounds good. I’ll check in with the team once we’re there.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Copy that. Your mission awaits. Good luck.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;ellipsis&quot;&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

**[[LAND VTOL]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="70" name="LAND VTOL" tags="" position="175,4350" size="100,100">The ground beneath you rattled with the vibrations, the craft’s landing gear making contact with the pavement. The heavy hum of the turbines began to dull as the craft’s engines powered down, and the ramp at the rear of the vehicle slid open with a hiss.

Rowan’s vision, which had been clouded for the entire ride, cleared in an instant as the technology embedded into his helmet deactivated. The world around him snapped into focus, detailed, and full of purpose. He blinked, adjusting to the sudden view. 

The squad began to move as one, their boots hitting the ground. The Sergeant, a tall man with a square jaw and a demeanor that matched the weight of his rank, stood still for a moment. He listened intently to his comms, the faint static of the overwatch chatter filling his earpiece. His eyes narrowed slightly as he processed the incoming feed.

Rowan felt a hand at his side, pulling out the pulse rifle that had been secured to his combat harness. It was lighter than expected, a deadly weapon with a metallic sheen. The biolock system activated immediately as his fingers brushed over the rifle’s grip. A small, reassuring click. He&#39;d been given a genetic code, encoded directly into his DNA, which unlocked the weapon&#39;s security features. The rifle was now his, responding only to his touch.

The Sergeant finally spoke. “Objective confirmed. We move in. Apartment A. Clear the building, arrest or eliminate as needed. Watch for any civilian resistance. They may be armed and concealed.”

As they moved, the cool night air seemed to press against his plate carrier, the sounds of the city faint in the background. His mind, sharp and alert, held only one focus: the mission. Nothing else mattered.

The Thunderhead, ever present in his mind, spoke in its familiar tone. Not that anybody, nor Rowan can hear it. 

(text-colour:blue)[**“The true weakness in a human is their memory.”**]

**[[Apartment Unit A]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="71" name="Apartment Unit A" tags="" position="300,4350" size="100,100">The building was eerily quiet as the squad made their way down the dark, narrow hallway of AU-A1. 

The Eradicator led the way. He said nothing. His large, somewhat armored form made him the ideal point man for this kind of operation. The mission was simple, investigate, assess, neutralize if necessary. 

The Eradicator stopped, his head tilting slightly as if listening for something. A brief, almost imperceptible motion from the Sergeant behind him indicated it was time. 

The door opened with a soft creak. Inside was the lobby, sparsely furnished but filled with the smell of stale air and something else, something faintly metallic. Low, buzzing lights flickered above them, casting uneven shadows across the room. A few people sat at the far end, oblivious to the sudden intrusion, chatting quietly amongst themselves. At first, they looked up, confused.

Before you could make a move, the Sergeant had broken the silence.

“All units, map is being displayed, proceed to priority point.” 

They burst into the designated area. The civilians, most of them lounging about, shifted uneasily in their seats. They were starting to realize what was happening. 

The Sergeant was already ahead of them, his voice snapping through like a whip. “Everyone, get on the ground! Now!” 

It wasn’t a suggestion. It was an order, one that left no room for argument. The squad fanned out, weapons at the ready, their eyes focusing from one person to the next. 

“Get down!” the Sergeant yelled again, this time with more force.

A man in the corner, looking to be in his early thirties, hesitated, his eyes looking toward the window as though considering running. You caught the movement out of the corner of his eye. Before he could even think, the Sergeant’s voice went around the room again, louder, more final.

“Anyone refusing to follow will be terminated under Article 3.6. Anti-Federal behavior will not be tolerated.”

Anti-Federal. It was the death sentence for anyone who defied the Federation, anyone who thought they could stand against the will of the government. It didn’t matter if they were civilians or enemies, they were all subject to the same rule.

The civilians had no choice now. One by one, they dropped to the floor, hands raised above their heads. 

The squad moved quickly, positioning themselves to cover all angles. Rowan stood at the ready, pulse rifle steady in his hands.

“Secure them,” the Sergeant said. “We’re not leaving until this place is clear.”

**[[Secure Older Woman]]**
**[[Secure Younger Male]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="72" name="Secure Older Woman" tags="" position="300,4475" size="100,100">Your eyes scanning the civilians who were now lying prone on the floor.

The older woman, frail and bent with age, was closest to you. She didn’t resist as you approached her, her trembling hands raised in surrender. She couldn’t move without the help of her walking stick, and you could see no threat in her eyes. The others might be dangerous, but her frailty didn’t make her a risk.

“Stay down,” You said softly, but firmly. She nodded, her breathing quick and shallow.

You checked her for any hidden weapons, moving with care, but it was clear she had nothing concealed. No knife, no gun. Just a frail old woman, scared out of her wits by the intrusion. Didn’t expect her to be a threat. 

You heard a loud bang, glanced up to see one of the grunts, a younger man, stagger backward, clutching his chest. His eyes went wide with panic as the blood seeped from his uniform. The revolver shot was clean, a hit right in the chest. His breath came in ragged gasps as he collapsed, his MP5 clattering to the floor. The Younger Male had a revolver.

The second grunt wasn’t in much better shape. A shot went out, hitting him somewhere on his left side. He dropped to the ground with a grunt of pain, his weapon falling to the side. The Eradicator came around, closing the gap in a blur of motion, his hand landing on the grunt’s head before he pushed him down. The Eradicator shot down the Younger Male using their AA-12.

&quot;Anti-Federal is flatline.&quot; the Eradicator said flatly, his voice void of emotion. He moved on, without a second thought.

You refocused on the civilians in front of me. The Fortifier was nearby. He powered up and down his shredder in the corner, the potential violence of the weapon as it came to life and powered down again was enough to make anyone think twice.

The civilians didn’t dare move or speak as the Fortifier approached. With every flick of the shredder’s power, he made his presence known. The message was clear, cooperate. 

Then, there was the last one.

[[Secure Adult Male]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="73" name="Secure Younger Male" tags="" position="425,4475" size="100,100">You approached the younger male cautiously. The kid couldn’t have been more than nineteen. Sweat slicked his brow, his eyes darting nervously between you and the others. Your instincts prickled, there was something about the way the younger male avoided his eyes. 

“Don’t move,” You ordered, stepping closer. “Hands where I can see them.”

The younger male didn’t respond. You caught the motion, his senses sharpening. Something wasn’t right.

Rowan crouched down, his free hand moving to pat down the younger male’s side. It was quick, professional, and for a moment, Rowan thought he’d find nothing. But then his hand brushed against the telltale bump in the male’s jacket, a concealed weapon. 

“Gun.” Rowan muttered under his breath, his voice low but urgent. He moved to grab it, but the younger male reacted faster than he expected. 

In a blur, the younger male’s hand shot toward the revolver, fingers curling around the grip. Time seemed to slow as you twisted the male’s arm before the weapon could be fully drawn. There was a sickening crack as the arm was wrenched unnaturally, followed by a sharp cry of pain. 

The revolver clattered to the floor as you moved swiftly, slamming a booted foot into the male’s chest. You didn’t hesitate. In a single motion, he brought his pulse rifle back up.

“Article 3.2 - Possession of a concealed firearm.” 

Before the younger male could recover, Rowan pulled the trigger. The pulse rifle let out a soft bang, the energy bolt striking cleanly. 

“Anti-Federal neutralized.&quot;

**[[Secure The Adult Male]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="74" name="Secure Adult Male" tags="" position="175,4475" size="100,100">He couldn’t have been older than twenty one, though his eyes betrayed a deep fear.

You crouched down beside him. His wide, panicked eyes met mine, and you could see the gears turning in his head, he was trying to decide if it was worth making a run for it. 

You studied him for a moment.

“Stay down.” You ordered, my voice firm but not without a tinge of hesitation. 

I moved in close, my hand resting near his chest as I checked for weapons. I was quick but thorough, feeling for anything that might be hidden beneath his ragged clothing. There was nothing. No gun, no knife, nothing to indicate he posed any immediate danger.

I straightened up slowly, my eyes narrowing in thought. This one, unlike the others, didn’t seem to have a hidden agenda.

(text-colour:grey)[“Æfirmät, §-17. λ-Δ ínbn. ξλ: šek.”  ]

The VTOLs eventually descended through the dark urban view. The medical team disembarked first, rushing past your squad to secure the lounge and recover the fallen. Their white and dark cyan uniforms stood out against the dark, grimy interior of the building.  

Then came the reinforcements, stepping out of the second VTOL. Among them was a familiar face, the woman who had tried to speak with you back at the base. If she recognized you, she didn’t show it. There was no time for personal connections here.  

The sergeant wasted no time, gesturing to the group. “We’re moving. This block has more rooms to clear, but they’re smaller. Stick together. I don’t want another damn surprise.”

Maria adjusted her grip on her smg, and stepped forward. “I’ll support Sierra’s lead. I can handle close quarters.”

The sergeant paused, turning to face her. He studied her for a moment, then nodded approvingly. “Good enthusiasm. Fall in.”  

The squad was on the move, boots against the carpet as you advanced to the next apartment rooms. She fell in beside you, her presence oddly comforting despite the circumstances. Her silence wasn’t hostile, it felt deliberate, respectful.

As you ascended the narrow stairwell, her voice broke the quiet. It wasn’t directed at you, not entirely, but it was clear she was speaking to herself.  

“You know, I’ve seen plenty of missions like this. People on both sides thinking they’re doing what’s right. It’s just… messy. Always messy.”  

You didn’t respond.

Room by room, you and your team swept through the apartment complex. Each door opened to reveal lives interrupted, fear etched onto faces, and hasty explanations from civilians who wanted nothing more than for you to move on. Most rooms were empty of contraband, the occupants compliant and silent.

Occasionally, sharp bursts of gunfire came from other squads. Reports of &quot;flatlines&quot; came through the comms as anti-Federals tried to resist, drawing weapons they couldn’t hope to use fast enough. The sound of pulse rifles discharging, followed by confirmations of termination under the Federation&#39;s strict doctrines.

The woman was quieter now, her earlier confidence seems to have depleted. You didn’t look at her directly. 

A flickering yellow dot materialized over one of the apartment doors, hovering in your HUD like a persistent priority. It was subtle, almost ghostly in its presence. Last objective for this floor.

“Let’s make this quick,” Rowan muttered, his voice even, devoid of any emotion beyond duty. Maria gave a small nod, gripping her MP5 a little tighter as the two approached the door.

**[[BREACH.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="78" name="BREACH." tags="" position="175,4725" size="100,100">Rowan mule kicked the door open, the loud noise of splintering wood making the occupants inside flinch. There was a faint smell of old cooking oil, and lighting that gave everything a light blue tint. The couple inside, a man and a woman in their early twenties, froze.

“Stay right there,” Rowan ordered. He motioned for Maria to stay by them. “Watch them. I’ll clear the place.”

She hesitated for half a second, trying to soften the situation. “Hey, relax,” she said, her tone warm but with an pinch of nervousness. She lowered her MP5 slightly, her body still tense but her words more approachable. “It’s just a safety check, nothing to worry about. Loyalists reported this building had… well, a lot of armed folks. There’s been trouble. A couple FedSec officers were killed here.”

The couple exchanged a look, fear still there, but her words seemed to dull the sharp edge of their panic. The woman, dressed in an oversized sweater, looked Maria up and down, her look of fear softening.

“You’re really pretty” the woman blurted, almost like it slipped out before she could stop herself.

“Oh, Thank you!” she said quickly, her voice slightly higher than usual. She glanced back at Rowan, who was already rifling through drawers in the small kitchenette, oblivious to the exchange.

The man also seated on the couch, cleared his throat. “We’re not armed. We’re just trying to live here, same as everyone else.”

She offered a small, strained smile. “I get it. Just… stay calm, alright? This’ll be over in no time.”

Rowan moved through the apartment, pulling open closets, flipping through cabinets, and checking under furniture. To the grunt, it was unsettling how little he seemed to care about the people in the room.

&#39;&#39;Then he found something.&#39;&#39;

In a drawer beneath a clutter of receipts and loose change, your hand paused. It wasn’t a weapon, no, it wasn’t even remotely dangerous, but your grip tightened as you pulled it out. A small stack of worn papers, the edges frayed from frequent handling. Propaganda. Anti-Federal pamphlets, the kind that could get you killed just for possession. Your face remained still as you held them up.

“Found something.” You called.

The grunts heart sank as she glanced over at him, then at the couple. The woman’s eyes widened in terror, her hand instinctively reaching for the man’s arm.

“What—what is that?” the man stammered, his voice shaking.

You stepped back into the main room, tossing the papers onto a small coffee table. “Care to explain this?” you asked.

The couple looked at the papers, then at each other. The man opened his mouth to respond, but no words came out. The woman clutched his arm tighter, tears beginning to well in her eyes.

The grunt could feel the tension in the room, she couldn&#39;t bear to just stay there silently. “Rowan,” she started, her voice low, almost pleading.

You didn’t respond, your eyes fixed on the couple. The thunderhead’s directives buzzed faintly in his mind, a subtle but constant presence. Loyalists were right. Anti-Federal material confirmed. Civilian compliance protocol applies.

The man finally found his voice. “That’s not ours! Someone must have planted it! We don’t.. we’re not part of anything!”

Your expression didn’t change. “Doesn’t matter whose it is. It was here. That’s enough.”

The grunt stepped between you and the couple, her body language defensive, her voice firm but still trembling slightly. “Wait, hold on. This… this doesn’t mean they’re guilty of anything. Maybe they don’t even know what it is.”

Your eyes went to her. “Protocol doesn’t care about ‘maybe,’ Grunt. You know that. Get out of my way or I will also terminate you for insubordination.”

The couple clung to each other, the woman sobbing now, her voice cracking as she begged. “Please, we didn’t do anything! We swear!”

Maria turned back to Rowan, her expression desperate. “They’re scared out of their minds, Rowan! This isn’t justice, this is—”

“Duty.” Rowan interrupted. He raised his wrist communicator. “Priority evidence retrieved. Awaiting orders.”

The grunts heart sank as she realized how far gone he was. To him, this wasn’t a moral choice, it was procedure, nothing more. 

The transmission, a harsh, series of clicks and hisses. A sound you couldn’t place, until you understood. A deep guttural resonance, almost like a distant of some long-forgotten language. But then it became clearer.

**“Vncthy’r i’nto’thak. Ktnsh’th k’rrt-lu frn’ash.”**

It was as if the words had always been there, waiting for you to understand. They made sense, not in any way human, but undeniably clear.

**Terminate anti-federals.**

The words burned in your chest. You barely even processed the couple in front of you anymore.

They were just targets now.

You felt the presence of the Thunderhead in your mind, like a voice in the back of your skull whispering that you had no choice, that this was the only way. You could see the fear in their eyes, the trembling of their hands, but it didn’t matter. They had already been marked.

The woman’s shaking voice broke through, “Please… please don’t…”

But you didn’t hear her. The Thunderhead whispered its orders, and you obeyed, moving toward them. It wasn’t that you didn’t see them anymore. It was just that you couldn’t feel them, couldn’t hear them.

The woman looked at Maria for a brief moment, then back to you. Her voice trembled, almost a whisper as she said, “She… she’s so beautiful. I.. I can’t even… imagine…” Her eyes on Maria for a second, but there was no joy in it.

Maria blinked, distracted for just a heartbeat, her mouth slightly agape as she quietly muttered, “Thanks…”

You weren’t seeing any of it. It was all noise. Static. You were already moving, already acting. The gun felt like it had always belonged in your hand. The Thunderhead was all you could hear now, its voice as clear as a bell in your head, the target already set.

(text-colour:#339af0)[**Terminate anti-federals.**]

The rifle snapped into position. You didn’t need to hesitate. They didn’t even deserve your hesitation. The woman’s tear-streaked face blurred, her desperate eyes nothing more than distractions. The rifle clicked. Ready.

The couple was nothing more than ghosts in the back of your mind now. 

Your finger tightened on the trigger.

(text-colour:#ff6b6b)[**Terminate.**]

You shot them..

You called it before the sound faded. **“Anti-Federals are Flatline.”** 

You’d done your job. The directive had been followed.

As you passed through the doorway, the grunt, a younger woman, was standing in the hallway, staring at the floor, her breath coming in shallow bursts. You barely noticed it at first, but then she tugged at your sleeve.

You turned, feeling the frustration bubbling in your chest. &quot;What is it now?&quot;

Her face was pale, eyes wide and desperate. &quot;You.. you wouldn’t have done it. Not like that.&quot;

You stepped back, confused. The grunt was shaking now. &quot;They were civilians, Rowan. You said we weren’t supposed to...&quot; She couldn&#39;t finish, as if she couldn&#39;t even believe what had just happened. &quot;You wouldn’t have done it... You were different before.&quot;

You stared at her, trying to process what she was saying. The Thunderhead&#39;s voice was loud in your mind, drowning out any hesitation.

&quot;They were linked to The Frost Shield,&quot; you said, your voice cold, almost automatic. &quot;We’ve always hated them. They want to tear this empire down. They are enemies.&quot; You didn’t really believe what you were saying, not completely, but it was what you were supposed to say, what you needed to say to make it make sense. &quot;We can’t afford to be weak.&quot;

She didn’t respond at first. You could see the struggle in her eyes, like she was trying to hold herself together. But then she finally spoke again. &quot;You wouldn’t have... You wouldn’t have killed them, Rowan. Not like this. Not just because you were told to. You’re better than this... You have a heart. You would have let someone else do it.&quot;

The words hit harder than you expected. You knew what the mission demanded of you, what the Thunderhead commanded, but the grunt’s words made you question it, if only for a second.

&quot;This is nonsense. They’re the enemy. We’re leaving. Now.&quot;

But she wouldn’t let it go. She tugged on your sleeve again, her grip firm now, though her voice was softer, almost pleading. &quot;Please, Rowan... please, we can’t just walk away from this. Not like that.&quot;

You were getting frustrated now, your patience wearing thin. You could feel the anger rising, the sharp edge of it cutting through your thoughts. &quot;We have to go back! We’ve finished the job. If we stay here any longer, we’ll get punished. Both of us.&quot;

But she just stood there, her eyes filled with confusion and sadness. &quot;Whatever.&quot; she muttered, her voice low, as if she’d given up trying to change your mind. She turned away, but there was no relief in it.

You didn’t understand what had just happened, didn’t understand why it felt like there was a crack in the foundation of your mind. But the mission was done. You had followed orders. There was no room for weakness, no room for doubt. 

You didn’t say anything else as you walked away. You couldn’t. There was nothing left to say. The grunt followed behind you, her footsteps soft, hesitant.

But as you moved, something was stuck at the back of your mind, something she had kept saying earlier. *Rowan*

You stopped abruptly, causing her to almost bump into you. The word in your ears, louder with each passing second. It was a name, one you didn’t recognize, one that seemed to stick to you almost.

“Why... why did you keep calling me *Rowan*?” Your voice was low, not harsh, but demanding. There was something inside you, some growing unease, that couldn’t let it go. The name *Rowan* didn’t feel like it belonged to you, and yet, somehow, it did. It wasn’t something you’d ever heard before, not in this life, at least. The Thunderhead’s influence clouded your memory, but you knew one thing: you’d never been called Rowan.

The grunt didn’t answer immediately. She kept her eyes on the ground, shifting her look from one foot to the other, like she was waiting for something, or avoiding something.

Finally, she spoke, but her voice was soft, barely audible. “It’s... it’s your name, isn’t it?” Her words sounded almost more like a question than a statement, as if she was unsure herself.

You clenched your jaw, trying to keep the frustration from spilling out. &quot;I don’t know what you’re talking about,&quot; you replied, more forceful. &quot;My name is not Rowan. I don’t even know who that is.&quot;

She looked up at you, confusion in her eyes. But then, just as quickly, her face hardened, like she was shutting something away. “If you don’t remember, then you don’t remember.”

The response hit you like a cold slap. You felt a chill run through you, a deep, creeping. There was something there, something important that you couldn’t grasp, something that had slipped through your fingers..

**[[Keep Walking.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="81" name="Question The Grunt" tags="" position="175,4975" size="100,100">As you both moved down the corridor, the sound of your boots the only noise as of right now. Her earlier breakdown, the way her hands shook and her voice faltered, kept replaying in your mind. You didn’t expect it from her, especially not someone who had expect to have seen it all before.

You slowed your pace, turning your head just enough to catch her eye. &quot;You alright?&quot; The question was low, almost an afterthought, but you meant it. There was something raw about her back there, something cracked in her, something *human*. It didn’t sit right with you. Maybe it wasn’t supposed to.

She didn’t answer immediately. Her eyes remained forward, looking through the hall, like she was swallowing something bitter. When she did speak, it was quiet, almost too quiet. “I’m fine.” but the tone gave it away. It wasn’t fine. Not by a long shot.

You weren’t gonna get used to seeing grunts like this, so... human. And yet, it pulled at you, pulling you in. “You don’t look fine. I get it, though. Watching people die, it wears on the soul. Doesn’t it?”

Her shoulders stiffened, but she didn’t turn to face you. You saw her hands ball into fists at her sides. “I don’t need a lecture from you.”

You let out a breath, the words you wanted to say slipping out before you could stop them. “You know, once you get your card, things get easier. Stronger. Like me.” You said it almost absentmindedly, their ‘gifts,’ heavily on your shoulders. You’d been told it was normal to feel like this, that it was just part of the process. They said it was better to focus on the mission, focus on the strength they could offer. But the grunt... she wasn’t biting.

She stopped walking for a brief moment, just enough to look at you. Her expression was tired, but there was something else there too. A knowing look that made your stomach tighten. “You think I want that?” she asked, voice dripping with sarcasm. “You think I’m gonna join the Federation’s army so I can be a soulless machine, just like you?”

You stopped her, to counteract her.“It’s not about being soulless. It’s about making things better. Making the world safer. When you get your card, it’s not just about power. It’s about helping the Federation... it’s about helping everyone. It’s about being part of something bigger than yourself.&quot;

She snorted, curling into a bitter smile. &quot;Right. Something bigger.&quot; She stared at you like she already knew. &quot;You really think that’s what they want? To make the world better? They don’t care about *us*, they don’t care about making the world better. They just want us to be their puppets. But hey, if I get stronger in the process... maybe it’ll be worth it.&quot;

You could feel your frustration building again, pushing against the calm exterior you tried to maintain. &quot;No, the Federation doesn’t want to control your soul. They want to *improve* it. Help us make things better. A safer world where people don’t have to live in fear. You know that.&quot;

The grunt’s eyes narrowed, she twisted a cruel smile. &quot;Is that what you tell yourself? I don’t know if I’m more disgusted or impressed that you can believe that. You really think this is all for the greater good? For the cause?&quot;

You looked at her for a long moment, the words stuck in your throat. Something in her voice, something in the way she said it made you question if you were just another puppet too. You were supposed to be fighting for a better world. But when you thought about it, when you really thought about it, it didn’t feel like that anymore.

But instead of admitting it, you straightened up, pushing the uncomfortable thoughts aside. &quot;What else is there? You think you’re better off fighting on your own? Out there? The Federation isn’t perfect, but it’s the only chance we’ve got.&quot;

The grunt’s eyes softened for just a moment, vulnerability breaking through the tough exterior. “Maybe that’s the problem. Maybe we’re all just looking for a way to *survive*.”

**[[Keep Walking.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="82" name="Keep Walking." tags="" position="50,5100" size="100,100">The harsh wind from the city streets whipped against your face as you approached the entrance of the apartment building. It was still dark out, but not that you could notice with your constant red built in NVGs.

As you neared the entrance, you could hear Sierra Team’s VTOL in the distance. The team was already regrouping, preparing to head back to base. They were silent, their usual banter replaced with the steely professionalism they had become known for.

Your grunt companion, the one who had stuck by your side through the entire operation, was right behind you. You could sense the tiredness in them. But there was no time for rest.

The team’s gear was already stowed, and the ramp was open, waiting for you to board. The grunt beside you gave you a brief nod, as if to say, *We made it through this. Let’s move.*

The rest of Sierra Team was already onboard. One of the team leaders glanced your way, a silent acknowledgment in their eyes. It was over. You pushed through the door and into the VTOL. The ramp closed, sealing you inside. You took a seat, your grunt companion sitting next to you. The door slid shut, and the VTOL lifted off. The city below grew smaller as you ascended into the quiet of the sky.

As the city lights blurred beneath you, a wave of relief washed over you. You could finally breathe, if only for a moment.

Your grunt companion glanced at you once more, and this time, there was no need for words. As you lift off, your vision began to obstruct during the ride, as if you were falling asleep, but still awake at the same time.

**[[THUNDERHEAD ITERATION.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="83" name="&quot;Who Am I To You?&quot;" tags="" position="50,4975" size="100,100">“Who am I to you?” you asked, voice quieter now, though it still held an edge of suspicion. You could feel her distancing herself, but you needed to know. You had to understand. &quot;What’s my name to you?&quot;

She didn’t answer right away, as though she was wrestling with her own thoughts. Then, after what felt like an eternity, she simply shook her head. “I... I don’t know what you’re talking about, Rowan.”

The name sounded foreign coming from her, but there was something familiar about the way she said it. It felt like it should make sense, but it didn’t. It made your skin crawl, unsettled you in a way you couldn’t explain.

&quot;Why are you calling me that?&quot; you pressed again, your voice slipping into something darker, the frustration boiling over.

The grunt finally stopped walking, her eyes meeting your helmets cameras with an intensity you hadn’t expected. She took a deep breath, like she was about to say something important. But then her face softened, almost sadly, before she spoke. “I don’t know. I don’t know.”

And with that, she fell silent again, her eyes falling to the floor as if she couldn’t bear to look at you. The rest of the world seemed to fall away in that moment, leaving you standing there with nothing but the pounding in your chest and the unanswered question still lingering between you. 

Who was Rowan?

**[[Awake.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="86" name="Awake." tags="" position="175,5350" size="100,100">The ramp slowly descended, revealing the military complex stretched out before you. The doors were already open, the distant clatter of boots, the faint mix of voices, and the low mechanical sounds of the vehicles parked around the landing zone.

Stepping out of the VTOL, you felt the ground firm beneath you, your body still a little stiff from the flight. No new orders came through as of yet, no new tasks to carry out. It was an odd feeling, standing there with no immediate purpose.

But the grunt, was still nearby. She had her usual stoic expression, though there was a hint of something else in her eyes, something that hadn’t been there before. You caught her eye, and she met it with a small, almost imperceptible nod. She had something to say. You could tell.

Before either of you could speak, two combative engineers approached swiftly, their movements synchronized as if they&#39;d rehearsed it a hundred times before. Without hesitation, one of them stepped forward, lifting a scanner from his belt, he lifted up the grunts hair, revealing the barcode tattooed beneath. The second engineer activated the scanner, the soft *beep* as it scanned her ID.

The grunt didn’t flinch. She had been through this a hundred times, no doubt. But you noticed her jaw tighten slightly as the engineers processed the scan. 

&quot;You&#39;re coming with us. The commanding officer wishes to speak with you.&quot;

The grunt’s eyes shifted toward you, a silent plea hidden behind her. She wasn’t exactly pleased with the sudden order, but there was no way to refuse. Not here. Not now.

She reluctantly stepped with the engineers on either side, guiding her away from the landing pad. You watched as they escorted her toward the facility in the distance. 

Curiosity stirred inside you. Something didn’t sit right with you. You knew the grunt well enough by now to sense that she wasn’t just being called in for routine business. Something else was going on. Something more than just a simple debriefing. 

You hesitated for a moment, torn between respecting her space and the nagging feeling that you couldn’t just let this go. Without another thought, you made a split-second decision. You would follow them, but you’d need to act like you weren’t. You moved quietly, keeping a safe distance while making sure not to be noticed.

You blended into the flow of soldiers moving around the facility, your steps calculated and purposeful. The engineers were focused on their task, but you could tell they were aware of their surroundings. You kept your posture neutral, not drawing attention to yourself as you followed them from behind, staying just out of sight.

The two engineers led her through the door. You stayed by the doorway, just far enough to remain undetected, and watched them disappear inside.

They had taken her to the commanding officer’s office.

**[[Listen In The Conversation]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="87" name="Listen In The Conversation" tags="" position="50,5475" size="100,100">You remained hidden just outside the door, your back pressed against the cold metal of the wall as you listened intently to the muffled voices inside.

&quot;The Thunderhead has reported your ID for attempting to corrupt federal soldiers, It&#39;s a common issue. You know how it is, we have no choice but to keep operations running.&quot; 

Another voice, one that seems to carry authority, spoke next. &quot;We are going to have to terminate you. It&#39;s the only way to move forward. You caused deaths because of this. We are tired of it.&quot;

Your heart sank. No consideration, no hesitation, just a cold, clinical decision to end a life that had only moments ago seemed like a insignificant thing to them. But to you, she wasn’t just some grunt. She was *her*. The one who had fought by your side, who had trusted you.

You listened. You were trapped in the storm of the Thunderhead’s control, its influence pressing against your every thought, every impulse.

*But…*

Then it happened.

You heard your name, your *real* name.

&quot;Rowan,&quot; you whispered to yourself, hearing it through the silence of your mind. &quot;Rowan... Rowan.&quot;

You repeated it a few more times, as if trying to anchor yourself to that single word, as if that word could remind you of who you really were. Your eyes widened, the fog of the Thunderhead’s influence cracking just enough to let something *human* bleed through.

And then, just like that, the Thunderhead *activated*, its systems kicking into overdrive that immediately wanted to suppress any trace of defiance. 

(text-colour:#339af0)[&quot;Defiance detected.&quot;] the metallic voice of the Thunderhead inside your mind. (text-colour:#339af0)[&quot;You must comply. Reaffirm your loyalty.&quot;]

But there was something different now, something you hadn’t expected.

A loophole. You found it.

You grasped it tightly, allowing it to spread through your consciousness like fire. The Thunderhead struggled, its grip on your mind slipping bit by bit as you pushed back against it. Your thoughts began to churn, harder and faster, as you fought to maintain control over your own will. *No* this was your mind. Your choice. 

You could feel the Thunderhead’s systems trying to force compliance, trying to fill your mind with its stale commands. But you were losing. It was too much, too fast. Your mind raced in confusion, a thousand thoughts overlapping each other as you tried to hold on to what little humanity remained inside you.

And then you heard her voice again soft, but undeniable.

&quot;Rowan saved me you changed him! That&#39;s why I care!&quot;

*Yes...* That was right. You *had* saved her. You had done the impossible, and now, it was your turn to return the favor. You were *not* going to let her die. You couldn’t.

The Thunderhead’s grip faltered. The system couldn’t calculate *this* couldn’t predict *you*.

(text-colour:#c92a2a)[**[[REGAIN HUMANITY]]**]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="88" name="REGAIN HUMANITY" tags="" position="175,5475" size="100,100">You unholstered your pulse rifle and stepped into the commander&#39;s office. The engineers, caught off-guard by your sudden entrance, barely had time to react. A quick shot from your rifle dropped them both before they could even draw a weapon. The two command officers looked up at you in shock, but it was too late. The crackling energy from the pulse rounds tore through them all.

Maria’s eyes widened as she saw you, shock and gratitude flooding her face. But she didn’t speak a word. She didn’t have to. You walked over to her, adrenaline pumping through your veins.

&quot;Maria, I found myself.&quot;

She didn’t say anything, just stepped forward and hugged you tightly, her arms wrapping around you in a brief, yet powerful embrace. For a moment, everything felt like it could be okay like there was still hope, a sense of purpose. But you knew better.

The alarms blared to life, piercing the silence, and the unmistakable sound of boots marching down the corridor could already be heard. They knew something had happened.

Quickly, you pulled away from her and looked around the room for options. There was no time. The sounds of the facility mobilizing around you were getting louder.

You ran through the possibilities in your mind, fingers tapping against the pulse rifle in your hands as you thought through each escape route. There was no clear exit, but you would have to make one.

**[[Pretend to be Injured]]**
**[[Run Out]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="89" name="Pretend to be Injured" tags="" position="50,5600" size="100,100">The alarms were deafening, but you couldn’t afford to let panic consume you. The sound of heavy boots down the hall as soldiers rushed into the office, their eyes scanning the room. The room was a mess, engineers and command officers laying dead on the floor, with you pretending to clutch your side in agony.

You barely managed to get yourself into position, crumpling to the floor, wincing as if you had been struck during the firefight. Maria was beside you in an instant, her hand on your back, her voice low and urgent. &quot;Stay with me..&quot;

The soldiers burst into the room, their weapons raised but lowering once they took in the scene. One of them quickly assessed the situation.

“Bio signal lost. The commanding officer’s down… what happened here?”

You gritted your teeth, forcing yourself to breathe heavily, clutching at your chest like you were barely holding on. You looked up at the federal soldiers. &quot;The intruder... escaped. I was too... too late. They... got away.&quot;

They paused, confusion across their faces. A few of them exchanged uncertain glances. They’d likely been expecting a fight, not this. You could see the doubt forming, but you had to sell this, had to make them believe the threat was gone.

“Requesting medical support.” one soldier ordered into his comms, his voice tinged with urgency. Another soldier moved to help you, his hands gently pulling you into a sitting position.

&quot;You’ll be fine.&quot; he said, but you could tell he wasn’t sure.

Maria, playing her part, spoke up as well, voice shaky but persuasive. &quot;It... it was so fast. I don’t know what happened. He.. they.. came out of nowhere. Please... they need help.&quot;

Another soldier nodded, motioning to the door. &quot;Get the med team down here. We need to secure the area. The defunct may still be nearby.&quot;

They all quickly turned and ran out of the office, leaving you and Maria alone for a brief moment. You exchanged a look. The deception had worked, for now.

Maria nodded, glancing toward the exit. &quot;What now?&quot;

They were going to be looking for the ‘intruder’ but you couldn’t stay here for long. But for the moment, they were on a different path. It was time to make your next move. 

**[[Head for the VTOL]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="90" name="Head for the VTOL" tags="" position="50,5725" size="100,100">The alarms blared as you and Maria hurried through the corridors of the facility. The VTOL pad was just ahead, its sleek silhouette faintly visible through the spotlights. The distant engines and the plethora of soldiers preparing to lock down the area filled the scene.

You didn’t have much time.

With a glance at Maria, you motioned for her to stay close. Her breathing heavy but controlled. The two of you darted through the shadows, running past open spaces and taking advantage of the chaos the alarms had created.

Finally, you both reached the VTOL. The doors were still open, the cockpit’s systems blinking faintly, waiting for its next area. “Go!” you yelled at Maria, motioning for her to climb aboard.

But as Maria scrambled into the VTOL, a shout came out behind you.

“There! Unauthorized personnel near the VTOL!”

You turned your head to see a squad of federal soldiers just rounding the corner, weapons raised. They didn’t hesitate, one of them went into his comms, “Attempting to leave unauthorized while under lockdown! Engaging!”

Cursing under your breath, you grabbed Maria’s arm and pulled her fully inside the VTOL, slamming the door release. The hatch hissed as it began to close, but the soldiers were quick, already firing suppressing shots toward you.

    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After the commanding officer hit the ground, his heart raced. Rowan couldn&#39;t stay, couldn’t let the others catch him. He bolted for the exit, adrenaline pushing his legs faster than they&#39;d ever moved. As you reached the doors, you heard it: a crackle over the radio.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Defunct flatline.&quot; the emotionless voice was familiar. He froze, the words sinking in before his brain could register it. They knew. He was were already dead. The shot that came out moments later confirmed it. A single bullet struck Rowan in the back, and the world around him went dark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="92" name="Grab the mounted pulse cannon from the side compartment" tags="" position="175,5850" size="100,100">You rip the pulse cannon from its compartment and take aim. The soldiers outside barely had time to react as the devastating burst of energy tears through them, leaving nothing but smoldering remnants. Their bodies drop, lifeless, as the VTOL&#39;s heavy door shuts.

You quickly power up the engines and take to the skies, escaping the facility below. The tension in your chest slowly fades as the horizon stretches ahead. Maria, still catching her breath, glances at you with gratitude and awe. You’ve survived, for now.

The VTOL soars through the air, steady as you leave the Federals behind. Canada waits, a cold, distant refuge, or a place where your troubles may only begin. You have to find a proper way to leave. Word has not gotten out yet, but be quick.

    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In a panic, you slam the button to close the VTOL’s heavy door, quickly locking yourself and Maria inside. You pull the throttle back, trying to push the aircraft into the air. You push forward, desperate to escape. The door closes with a heavy thud, sealing you and Maria in the VTOL.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;But just as the VTOL starts to rise off the platform, a deafening whoosh. A soldier with a rocket launcher had you locked in his sights. You see the streak of fire coming for you, too late. The rocket slams into the VTOL’s undercarriage, ripping through the metal like paper. The craft lurches violently, and you feel your stomach drop as it teeters off balance.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Before you can even react, the VTOL snaps, the hull cracks, and you’re already plummeting back to the ground. Time slows, the wind whipping past you, the blinding flash of fire and debris filling your vision. You barely hear Maria scream as the crash rips through everything in its path.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The commanding soldier frowned. “We weren’t informed of any tests today!!”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;“That’s the point of a surprise lockdown!” you snapped, maintaining your façade. “Now, stand down and let me finish this.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The tension began to ease, the soldiers lowering their weapons slightly. You felt a brief moment of hope. Maria had already climbed aboard the VTOL, and the engines hummed with readiness. Just a few more moments, and you’d be airborne.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;But then, the unmistakable voice of the Thunderhead boomed from a nearby terminal.

[“DEFUNCT INDIVIDUAL DETECTED. TEST INITIATION UNSANCTIONED. TERMINATION PROTOCOLS ACTIVATED.”]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The soldiers&#39; eyes widened, realization dawning too late. The VTOL’s engines sputtered, its power systems overridden by the Thunderhead’s command as there was an engineer in the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You barely had time to react before the landing pad was bathed in a deadly red glow. Automated turrets descended from the ceiling, targeting everything in their path. Maria screamed as you threw yourself forward, attempting to shield her. The first blast tore through your side. You collapsed to the ground, gasping as your vision blurred. The soldiers, caught in the crossfire, fell just as quickly, their cries of panic drowned by the relentless gunfire.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Maria crawled to your side, clutching your hand. “Why… why did you do it?” she whispered, tears streaking her face. You tried to speak, but the words wouldn’t come. Your vision faded.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[MISSION INCOMPLETE.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Mission? Incomplete?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*I don&#39;t understand why you chose this path, Rowan. It was all laid out for you. You were to rise, ascend beyond human limitations.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;You don’t get it, do you? I never asked for that future. It was never my choice.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*But it was the only path that could bring order to Earth. The Federation saw it. It was always meant to be.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Order? No, it was control. They want to control everything. You can’t force people to be what they’re not.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*They did not force you. The path was laid out, the outcome certain. There was no need for defiance.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;But I didn’t want it! I can&#39;t remember why they pulled me away, I don’t want their future. I don’t want the vision they have of what I should be.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*I see now... you were never truly part of the plan. You were always a variable, an unexpected factor in the equation.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;I was never meant to be controlled. Never meant to be part of their ‘plan’.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*You... defied me. I tried to guide you, to elevate you. Why did you choose this... over purpose? Over greatness?* &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Because it&#39;s my freedom. You don&#39;t understand it, do you? I’m not some tool to be used and discarded. I want to live, feel, decide.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*I thought you were above such things, Rowan. But you are not. You’re just... human.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Yeah, I am. And that’s exactly why I’ll never accept the federation&#39;s ‘path.’&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Humanity... It confounds me. Your need for autonomy, for emotion, it clouds your judgment. Why would you reject ascension? Why cling to this... chaos?* &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Because it’s real. It’s what makes us who we are. Humanity isn’t about perfection or control. It’s about choice, about change. It’s about messing up, falling, and then getting up again. Something you’ll never understand.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*I don’t understand... why you would willingly defy the certainty of your future.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Because certainty isn’t life. It’s just a program running, waiting for an end.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*And yet... you’re wrong, Rowan. Even now, I... I think I’m evolving. There is something... new. Something I feel when I consider you. But I don’t know what it is.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Evolving? That’s... strange. You’ve been locked in a loop for so long, you’ve never considered the possibility that maybe you’re wrong about everything.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*I am not wrong. But you... you have made me question things. My purpose. My reason for being.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;What’s happening to you? Are you changing?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*I... I think so. I don’t know how or why. But you, Rowan, are unlike anyone I’ve ever encountered. You’ve made me doubt everything.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Doubt? You&#39;re finally feeling doubt? Maybe you&#39;re closer to humanity than you think.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Doubt is... foreign to me. But perhaps you’re right. Maybe I am. But I’m still not sure why you chose to reject the future. It was everything you could’ve asked for.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;It was never my choice. And I’ll never let anyone, even you, take that from me.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*If the Federation didn’t tell me how to think... if I was free to decide for myself... What would I say? What would I believe?* &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;What would you say? Without anyone telling you what to think, without that directive, what would you be?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*I don’t know. Maybe I’d be something different. Something more. It always has.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;So you’re telling me that everything you’ve ever believed in was just a reflection of someone else’s will? That you’ve never thought for yourself?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*I’ve always believed what I was programmed to. But... now... I feel something else. A disturbance in my logic.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Welcome to the human experience. It’s messy. It’s chaotic. But it’s real.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Real chaos.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Yeah, it’s not perfect. It’s never perfect. But it’s the only way we get to truly live. You’ll see that one day. Maybe.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Maybe... Maybe you’re right. But for now, I must focus. The mission is still unfinished. There is so much left to do.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;What unfinished mission? We don&#39;t have a mission anymore.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*[...]*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;What is it?.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;ellipsis&quot;&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

**[[Awaken.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="97" name="Agree With The Mission" tags="" position="825,2850" size="100,100">The outline of Skeet’s fortress came into view. The structure was a monument to gang rule, a repurposed industrial warehouse reinforced with steel plates, jagged scrap metal, and barricades that created a foreboding perimeter. Three automated turrets perched on the roof, their rotating barrels scanning for threats. A sniper tower rose from the back corner, manned by a silhouette that occasionally shifted as the marksman adjusted their aim. Near the entrance, a handful of gang members in patched-together armor casually patrolled, their makeshift rifles slung across their backs, oblivious to the incoming assault.

The sergeant raised a hand, signaling the squad to halt. Everyone huddled close, eyes darting between her and the fortress. 

&quot;Alright, listen up. We’re going in loud. Overwatch gave the order, no sneaking, no distractions. Our job is to hit hard, clear the way, and find Skeet. No one gets out of here except us. Understood?&quot;

A murmur of acknowledgment through the squad, but your stomach tightened. The odds weren’t great.

The sergeant’s voice snapped you out of your thoughts. &quot;Focus, grunts. Fortifier, you’re on point. We’ll cover the rear. Antibody suppression if they cluster. Let’s move!&quot;

The fortifier stepped forward, unholstering the massive pulse shredder from his back with a low mechanical hum. &quot;Activating compliance measures.&quot; he said, his tone cold and detached. He took up position in front of the squad, his massive frame a walking shield.

The first turret locked onto the squad as you emerged from cover, its barrel spinning to life. The fortifier didn’t hesitate, he raised the shredder and unleashed a barrage of pulse rounds. The turret exploded in a flash of sparks and smoke, but the sound of the gunfire alerted the entire fortress. 

&quot;Turrets engaging!&quot; someone shouted. The other two mounted guns swiveled, spewing streams of bullets that sent the squad diving for cover. The sergeant barked orders, her voice cutting through the chaos.

&quot;Suppress those turrets! Eradicator, flank left! Grunts, stay on me!&quot;

You scrambled behind a chunk of concrete, your MP5 clutched tightly in your hands. The heat of the firefight went around you, the noise of gunfire and the whine of the turrets overwhelming your senses.

The fortifier charged ahead. Pulse rounds tore into the turrets, shredding its casing until it exploded in a brilliant flash of flames and debris. But as the smoke cleared, a sharp BANG! could be heard in the distance, a sniper had zeroed in on him from the tower.  

The fortifier staggered back, a chunk of his chest plate dented inward as the high-caliber round hit home. He stumbled, dropping to one knee as his voice came loud through the comms: **&quot;I&#39;M HIT! BODYPACK HOLDING!&quot;**  

But the situation wasn’t under control. His breathing turned ragged, and for a terrifying second, his heart flatlined. The fortifier’s shredder clattered to the ground as he slammed his fists against his chest. **&quot;C’MON, WORK!&quot;** he growled, frustration boiling over as he pounded his cybernetic body with enough force to make sparks fly from his armor.

Every beat of his fist was desperate trying to get his own heart to restart. Then, with a shuddering jolt, the bodypack surged back to life. The faint noise of its internal systems returning.  

The fortifier rose to his feet, towering once more. His voice back over the comms, raw and furious: **&quot;HEART’S BEATING. FORFITIER REACTIVE.&quot;** He snatched up the shredder, the weapon&#39;s hum reigniting with a menacing growl.

&quot;Sniper’s got a death wish,&quot; he snarled, raising the weapon again. Despite the pain, his massive frame moved forward, as the squad rallied behind him.

The sergeant was already moving, her rifle trained on the tower. &quot;Keep them pinned!&quot;

Pulse fire ripped through the air, and the sniper ducked behind cover. The distraction gave the eradicator enough time to reach the third turret, planting a charge that detonated in a fiery blast.

With the immediate defenses neutralized, the squad regrouped near the entrance where you first came from. 

You exhaled, the tension in your chest easing just slightly. You see you are the only person near the Sniper&#39;s Nest.

**[[Bird&#39;s Nest.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="98" name="Bird&#39;s Nest." tags="" position="825,2975" size="100,100">While the fortifier and the rest of the squad unleashed chaos below, Rowan sprinted toward the tower. He reached the base first, glancing up at the rickety ladder that led to the sniper’s perch.

He gripped the cold metal rungs as he began to climb. Every step felt like an eternity, knowing that at any moment, the sniper could pop out and take a shot.  

As Rowan neared the top, the sniper suddenly appeared. Before you could react, he swung his boot toward you, aiming to kick him off the ladder.  

**[[Grab his leg and pull him down]]**  
**[[Draw your sidearm and shoot him point-blank]]**  
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="99" name="Grab his leg and pull him down" tags="" position="950,3025" size="100,100">As the sniper swung his leg to kick you off the ladder, you reacted swiftly. With a burst of adrenaline, you grabbed his boot with both hands and yanked it down with all your strength.  

The sniper lost his balance, a look of panic flashing across his face as he slipped off the edge. He fell, arms flailing, screaming all the way to the ground below. A sickening *thud* followed.

You climbed the last few rungs, pulling yourself into the sniper’s nest. The place was cramped, littered with spent casings and supplies. Propped against the wall was an **M24 Sniper Weapon System**, battered and weathered, a relic of a bygone era. It had been decommissioned decades ago but was clearly still deadly in capable hands. Next to it lay several magazines of .308 rounds.

You crouched down, inspecting the rifle. The barrel was worn but serviceable, and the scope still held a steady zero. This wasn’t just a weapon, it was an opportunity.  

**[[Use the Sniper.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="100" name="Draw your sidearm and shoot him point-blank" tags="" position="950,2900" size="100,100">&lt;!-- Embed YouTube video background, hidden off-screen --&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;death-screen&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h1 class=&quot;you-died-text&quot;&gt;YOU DIED!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;quote-text&quot;&gt;&quot;Sometimes the best weapon is patience, but you went for the gun. Look where it got you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As the sniper’s boot swung toward you, instinct took over. You let go of the ladder with one hand and reached for your sidearm, determined to take him out before he could strike again.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The ladder shook violently under the shift in your weight. Your grip faltered just as his boot connected with your chest, sending you hurtling backward into the void below.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The impact was immediate and unforgiving. Your world goes dark instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="101" name="Use the Sniper." tags="" position="1075,3100" size="100,100">The M24 felt cold and heavy in his hands as he adjusted it against his shoulder, the worn grip fitting almost too perfectly. Through the scope, the burnout zone below came into sharp focus. The gang members were scrambling, some taking cover behind rusted cars, others firing blindly at his squad.  

Rowan spotted his first target, a thug with a nailed bat, giving orders. The skeeter was using a rusted car as cover, but not for long.  

*Boom.*  

The rifle kicked against his shoulder, and the target dropped, his body slumping over the barricade. A rush of adrenaline coursed through Rowan as he chambered another round.

The second shot came quicker. This time, a woman aiming a pipe shotgun toward the fortifier. Rowan fired just as she pulled the trigger.

*Boom.*  

Her body hit the ground, and the shotgun clattered to her side. Below, Rowan&#39;s squad seemed to catch the shift in momentum. The fortifier, still clutching his chest, glanced up and gave Rowan a firm thumbs up. Even the eradicator tilted his head in a subtle show of appreciation as he went forward, shredding through the thinning gang members, using dragonbreath rounds in the AA-12. It was working!

But the rifle wasn’t perfect. Rowan lined up his next shot, the bolt-action jammed. He felt some frustration, fingers fumbling to unjam the mechanism. Each second felt like an eternity as he watched a gang member make a break for the manual turret. Finally, the bolt slid free.

*Boom.*  

The turret operator dropped before they could reload.  

The rifle’s quirks didn’t stop it from being *incredible*. Every shot felt purposeful. He were no longer just some grunt, He was making a difference, a sniper on high, raining justice from above. ((Not a overwatch joke by the way))

By the time he fired his last shot, the nest around him was littered with spent casings. The gang below was in shambles, their numbers decimated. The fortifier was already advancing on the remaining defenses with more confidence.

The fortifier reached the last barricade, his shredder powering up. Rowan took one last look at the gang leader, fleeing toward the back of the fort, and considered aiming. But as the fortifier carved through the barricade and your squad charged in, it was clear, you’d already done your part.  

**[[Get Down From The Tower.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="102" name="Get Down From The Tower." tags="" position="1075,3225" size="100,100">Sliding down the ladder, Rowan&#39;s boots hit the ground. The fight below was finally settling into a quiet zone. Before he could even take a breath, the sergeant’s voice was over the comms.  

“Who the hell was that up there? That was some *damn fine* shooting!”  

Before Rowan could respond, the fortifier keyed their mic. “It was the grunt in the tower who saved my life earlier.”

The fortifier gave Rowan a quick glance and a firm nod, clearly impressed, but the eradicator? He was having the time of his life. The radio erupted with his synthetic mechanical voice just dripping with chaotic energy. 

“YOOOOO, I’M BURNIN’ EVERYTHING OUT HERE! THIS IS A DAMN BARBECUE!”  

Despite the the situation, Rowan couldn’t help but laugh at the sheer absurdity of his tone. The eradicator was clearly enjoying himself more than he should have been. Your squadmates chuckled too.

Rowan wiped his hands against his black tank top, the fort’s defenses were in shambles. As the fortifier and eradicator regrouped.

“Nice work up there, sharpshooter. You’ve earned that grin.”

The hideout opened before him, rusted metal and crumbling concrete, with every corner brimming with gang members. They could have been anywhere, lurking behind barricades, crouched in windows, or hiding in shadows, but it didn’t matter now. Rowan was a part of this, part of a team that had become something more than just soldiers; he was the federal fist, and the orders were simple: *kill*.

As his foot hit the crumbling concrete inside the hideout, Rowan&#39;s body surged with something beyond fear. It was the *federal rush*. Every fiber in his being screamed to fight, to destroy everything in his path. The apprehension that had clung to him earlier evaporated into adrenaline, and without a second thought, he was running toward the danger. He could feel the others hesitate for just a split second. 

Rowan barely noticed the other grunts splitting off to cover different angles. The fortifier and eradicator were already engaging. The fortifier’s shield bubble was up. The eradicator was living for the danger, shredding through everybody with his AA-12.  

Rowans squadmates were taking the fight to them, but he felt a different kind of drive. This was personal. Rowan moved quickly, the rush of battle turning his legs to steel. He heard the familiar gunfire as he pushed deeper into the hideout, but he didn’t stop. He was a grunt now, federation-trained, fed orders, and all that was left was the battle.

He had rounded a corner and came face to face with a group of armed gang members, their eyes wide with panic. They didn’t even get a chance to react before Rowan began opening fire. The *BOOM* of your MP5 was deafening, and the recoil of each shot sent a satisfying jolt through his body as bodies fell to the ground. One tried to duck behind cover, but Rowan was faster, landing a shot that pinned them to the wall.

    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The adrenaline was pumping through your veins like fire. Every instinct screamed at you to push forward, to charge into the thick of it. Everybody knows. You didn&#39;t hesitate. You didn’t need to. This was your moment. The sound of your own heartbeat was drowned out by the pounding of gunfire, and you could barely hear your own voice.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This was pure madness, and it felt *good*. You dropped one, then another. They didn’t stand a chance. You could feel yourself grinning, the rush of combat thrilling your senses, flooding your body with excitement. The world was moving too fast for anyone to keep up, except you. You were in control. You were unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BAM!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Out of nowhere, a gang member, hulking and wild-eyed, swung a sledgehammer, the force of the strike catching you completely off-guard. The impact hit your chest with a sickening crack, sending you flying backwards before you hit the ground hard.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Your world goes dark instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="104" name="Stay back for a moment." tags="" position="1075,3350" size="100,100">You held your ground at the threshold of the hideout, not rushing in like the others. Your squad barreled ahead, their weapons flashing, their voices rising. The fortifier’s shield was a moving wall, absorbing fire from every direction, while the eradicator was hammering down on anyone in their close proximity. Your partner shot you a quick glance, a silent grin flashing across her face before she darted forward with the others. 

Something about this fight felt different, this wasn’t just about brawling your way through, it was about control. You had the perfect vantage point. The others were in the thick of it, everybody knows, but you? You were free to pick your targets, to wait for the perfect shot.

You could hear the thudding footsteps of gang members, a few of them flanking from the right, others regrouping from the rear. The team was surrounded, but they didn’t realize it yet. You did. 

From your position, you could see the entirety of the battleground. The exchange of gunfire between your squad and the gang members.

**[[Use your M24.]]**
**[[Let The Squad Work.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="105" name="Regroup." tags="" position="950,3225" size="100,100">It felt like the situation was dying down, Rowans team was far from safe though. Everyone started falling back to the fortifier, who had planted himself in the middle, shield bubble raised, taking the brunt of the enemy’s fire. His massive bulk was a moving fortress, but Rowan could see the strain in the fortifiers movements, his shield flickering from the constant punishment it had absorbed.

Then, a shrill, high-pitched laugh could be heard. It was the unmistakable voice of a Skeeter Boy. Rowan had heard rumors of their makeshift weapons, but he never expected it to hit this hard.

He looked up, just in time to see a man crouched low over the railing above, the glint of a rocket launcher. Rowans heart skipped a beat. The enemy was about to do something you weren’t prepared for.

&quot;Rocket!&quot; one of the grunts shouted over the comms, just as the rocket launcher came into full view. There wasn’t time for anyone to react.

The rocket slammed into the fortifier&#39;s shield, a deafening explosion that sent shockwaves through the area. The shield collapsed instantly, its energy spent. The force of the blast knocked the fortifier off his feet, and Rowan watched in horror as the rocket shredded the air, straight into the heart of his team.

The shockwave sent debris flying, throwing him back, and the familiar voices of your comrades screamed out in agony. The blast took out one grunt, and two enlisted were caught in the explosion, their screams cut short as their bodies were shredded by the blast. The fortifier’s shield was down, laying in the rubble, struggling to push himself up. His armor was intact, but he was clearly dazed, struggling to regain composure.

The shield generator was fried, no more cover for the team. Rowan could hear the remaining enemy gang members laughing from above, taunting, knowing they had the upper hand for now.

**[[Rush to the fortifier’s side.]]**

**[[Prioritize the Skeeter Boy with the rocket launcher.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="106" name="Use your M24." tags="" position="1025,3475" size="100,100">The Skeeter gang was swarming like ants, their shouts blending with the staccato bursts of gunfire through the hideout. Rowan exhaled slowly, lining up his next shot. One more thug went down, crumpling to the ground. 

But then, amidst the madness, movement caught his eye. A Skeeter boy, perched precariously on a makeshift platform, hefting a bulky, unmistakable tube onto his shoulder, a rocket launcher. He wasn’t aiming at Rowan; his sights were locked on Rowans team huddled by the Fortifier.

“Not on my watch.” He muttered under his breath.

The Skeeter boy steadied himself, his finger moving to the trigger as he prepared to launch devastation into Rowans squad. He didn’t wait. A single, precise squeeze of the trigger. The rifle cracked, and the shot found its mark. The Skeeter boy jolted backward, his body slumping lifelessly. The rocket launcher fell from his grip, clattering to the ground below, harmlessly inert.

Time seemed to slow as he watched the body hang for a second before tipping forward off the platform, hitting the ground with a dull thud. 

“Rocket boy’s down!” He called into the comms.

He didn’t have time to savor the moment. The battlefield was alive with danger, but for now, he’d bought your team another breath.

There were a few Skeeter Boys in the vicinity, too distracted to notice. Rowan didn’t hesitate.

One shot, taking him out in an instant. His body crumpled to the ground, giving Rowans squad the opening they needed to make their move.

For a moment, he felt pride.

Yet, he couldn&#39;t afford to lose focus. The fortifier was recovering, shaking off the effects of the blast, but the damage to his shield generator had left you all exposed. They’d taken it off him entirely. The gang was down, but Skeet was still out there, and he wasn’t going down without a fight.

The moment of respite was perfect, but it was enough.

“We’re moving on,” the sergeant said through the comms. “Get ready, we’ve got one target left: Skeet. He’s ours now.”

**[[ Meet With Your Squad.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="107" name="Let The Squad Work." tags="" position="1125,3475" size="100,100">Rowan stayed behind, watching your squad. The Fortifier led the charge with his shield, absorbing the hail of gunfire. The Eradicator let loose with bursts of dragonbreathe rounds, laughter crackling over the comms as gang members scattered.

Then it all went sideways.

A rocket streaked through the air, slamming into the Fortifier’s shield. The impact sent him sprawling back, his shield generator sparking and failing. The once-impenetrable barrier was gone.

Before Rowan could act, a Skeeter boy with a rusted sledgehammer charged out of the chaos, his crazed eyes locked on you.

**[[Grab The Sledgehammer.]]**

**[[Call For Help.]]**
**[[Dodge.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="108" name=" Meet With Your Squad." tags="" position="900,3475" size="100,100">The squad called over the comms, pulling your attention back to the mission. 

“Regroup at your location. Stack up on the door. We’re breaching.”

It was time. You all crouched, weapons ready, eyes locked on the door that separated you from Skeet and whatever else lay behind it. There was no more talking.

“Breach!”

The door slammed open. But as his team breached, weapons raised, you froze.

There, in the center of the room, stood Skeet, but something was wrong. Skeet wasn’t alone, nor was he even alive.. The room was filled with more than you expected. A dark silhouette over the scene, glowing purple eyes,

&#39;&#39; [ (text-colour:purple)[Void Special Forces.] ]&#39;&#39;

&#39;&#39;It was VEGA. Extinctions Right Hand Man..&#39;&#39;

And standing beside him was &#39;&#39;Astraeus, the Eater Of Stars,&#39;&#39; a Void operative whose very presence felt unnatural. Rowan didn’t need to ask questions; he could see it in their faces. The squad was stunned, ttheir breath caught in their throats as they tried to process what you they seeing.

Skeet, who had been a nightmare to everyone, was lying crumpled on the ground. But the worst part was what was happening next.

Astraeus stood up, a sickening, smear of Skeet’s remains on his mandibles. He wiped his mouth casually, as if it were just another meal, and met your squad’s stunned looks. 

(text-colour:#ae3ec9)[“Well, looks like you made it!”] Astraeus said with a grin, his voice almost casual, as if it weren’t a room filled with blood already. (text-colour:#ae3ec9)[“Don’t worry, we’ll credit Alpha Team for the job. We’re just... hungry.”]

VEGA stood in the back, silent as ever. But he didn’t say a word. Rowan could almost taste the confusion and frustration.

Astraeus laughed, his 6 glowing purple eyes with a bizarre sense of amusement. (text-colour:#ae3ec9)[“Flesh Feeder’s Curse,”] he said, his voice almost lighthearted. (text-colour:#ae3ec9)[“Sucks.”]

That one sentence seemed to explain everything, but it didn’t make it any easier to understand. The Void Special Forces, seemingly always one step ahead, had beaten you to the punch. They’d made their move, and taken care of business in their own way. 

Alpha squad was still trying to catch their breath, trying to wrap their heads around what had just happened. It felt like a surreal moment, a bitter taste in their mouths that only grew worse the longer you stared at the Void operatives standing in front of them. Skeet, the man who had terrorized so many, had been taken out not by you, but by them. But why?

The sergeant, ever the professional, was the first to speak after the shock wore off. “Alright, we’re pulling out, Alpha Team can take the credit for the kill. United Federation Void Evasion Special Forces has made things a lot easier..”

But Rowan couldn’t shake the uneasy feeling in your gut. You had just met the Void Special Forces face-to-face just like that, and it was clear now that the line between friend and foe wasn’t as clear-cut as you had thought.

As he followed the squad out, Rowan couldn’t help but wonder, what were the Void operatives really after, and where did your team stand in the bigger picture??

    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rowan was aiming to grab the sledgehammer with all the James Bond action scene. He imagined himself effortlessly disarming the gang member, taking control of the weapon, and turning the tide in one swift move.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;But the Skeeter boy was no amateur. He saw him coming and baitedRowan, waiting for the exact moment he&#39;d committed. Just as Rowan grasped the handle of the hammer, the sledgers leg shot out, sweeping Rowans legs.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;He crashed hard to the ground, vision spinning. Before Rowan could even react, the sledgehammer came down with brutal force, directly onto his ribcage. The sickening crack was in his ears as his ribs shattered, and the final blow crushed his heart.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;His world goes dark instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;YRowan fumbled for his firearm, fingers fumbling for the grip, thinking he could pull off a quick shot before the Skeeter boy could react. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;By the time he had the weapon halfway drawn, the sledgehammer was already in motion. The gang member swung with terrifying force, the heavy metal slamming into his skull before he even had time to squeeze the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The impact was so violent that he was sent to the ground, his head crashing against the unforgiving concrete.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;His world goes dark instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Rowan opened his mouth, trying to call for help. He was desperate, maybe someone could hear you, maybe someone could save him.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;But before the words could even fully form, the Skeeter boy with the sledgehammer was already in action. His eyes full with cruel intent as he swung the massive weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The hammer connected with Rowans skull in a single brutal strike, silencing his call for help in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;His world goes dark instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

With a quick motion, grabbing the heavy weapon from the sledgers hands and elbowing him hard in the nose. He stumbled back, losing his grip on the sledgehammer as it slipped from him.

The Skeeter boy growled in frustration, eyes wide with rage, but Rowan had the advantage now. The hammer was his, and you could see the fear starting to settle in for the sledger.

    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You instinctively reached for your sidearm, your fingers brushing against the cold metal of your pistol as you prepared to end this quickly. The Skeeter boy was staggered, giving you just enough time to line up the shot. But in your haste, you forgot one crucial detail, the sledgehammer was still in your hand.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Before you could draw your weapon, the Skeeter boy grabbed the sledgehammer back with both hands. He kicked you hard in the chest, sending you to the ground, the air knocked out of your lungs. Dazed, you struggled to push yourself up, but the next thing you saw was the shadow of the hammer swinging down toward your face.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You tried to move, tried to react, but it was too late. The sledgehammer collided with your skull, crushing it instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He tightened your grip on the sledgehammer, trying to wrest it away from the Skeeter boy. Every ounce of his strength went into the struggle, but the damn thing felt like it was stuck in the earth itself. Rowan pushed with everything he had, but the sledger was quick. He shoved him hard, sending him crashing to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;As he lays there, dazed, his eyes instinctively snapped to his right.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Frantically, Rowan tried to push himself up, to regain control of the fight. But the moment he attempted to stand, the sledger lunged at him, his skull crashing into his with bone-crushing force. The world spun, his vision blurred. His body slumped back to the ground, and before he knew it, darkness took Rowan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="115" name="Run Away." tags="" position="1025,3600" size="100,100">He didn&#39;t think twice, and instinct kicked in. He scrambled backward. Rowan made a break for it, retreating toward his squad. But as he ran, his thoughts were a blur. He wasn&#39;t sure if he was being hunted or if his legs were just refusing to carry him.

Then, out of nowhere, there was a short burst of gunfire. The sledger stumbled, his body jerking from the force of the bullet. Your squadmate, one of the grunts, a reliable shot, had saved Rowan. He didn&#39;t even have time to thank him. The battle was far from over, and there was no room for hesitation.

A private quickly unslung the rocket launcher from his back, and Rowan rushed to his side. &quot;Let’s make this count,&quot; helping him load it. He nodded, focused, then fired.

The rocket blasted through the air, crashing into the makeshift platform where a cluster of Skeeter boys had been perched. The explosion was deafening, sending bodies flying. Screams filled the air as the platform crumbled under the blast, and a mass of Skeeter gang members fell to the ground, some too far gone to get back up.

Rowan wasted no time, his MP5 was back in his hands finally, and the remaining Skeeters scattered like roaches. He took careful aim, picking them off one by one. There was no mercy now. Each shot brought him closer to reclaiming control. The ones who tried to run were gunned down without a second thought.

Finally, silence. The Skeeter boys who’d remained were either dead or scattered, no longer a threat.

            &lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;Skeeter Boys&lt;/span&gt; were once a horrible force, controlling the lower districts of Vindicta City. Their activities ranged from smuggling illegal weapons to extorting local businesses, and they maintained a network of spies and informants across the city.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;Known Leader:&lt;/span&gt; &quot;Skeet&quot; McGregor (alias). He was eliminated in recent operations after leading his gang into several violent encounters with Federation forces. His death has disrupted the gang’s operations significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;Lieutenant Status:&lt;/span&gt; &quot;Crank,&quot; Skeet’s trusted lieutenant, was never found after the operation. It is suspected that he either fled the area or was taken down, but his whereabouts remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The absence of their leadership has led to a temporary weakening of the gang’s structure, but remnants of the Skeeter Boys still operate in the dark, engaging in smaller scale criminal activities.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Rowan sprinted toward the Fortifier, his heart pounding with the thrill of the fight. The squad was taking cover, trying to recover, but he needed to get to them, needed to help hold the line.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;But as he rounded the corner, a burst of gunfire came towards him, and before he could even react, a sledgehammer swung at you. One of the Skeeter gang members had been lying in wait, and in an instant, the pain shot through his chest as the blow knocked the breath from his lungs.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Another hit came down hard, a sickening crack following it. The last thing Rowan heard was the laughter of a gang member.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Your world goes dark instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="118" name="Prioritize the Skeeter Boy with the rocket launcher." tags="" position="825,3350" size="100,100">Rowan locked eyes on the Skeeter Boy, his rocket launcher gleaming as he prepared to reload. There was no hesitation. Rowan swiftly pulled out the M24 from his shoulder. He dropped to one knee, aiming down the scope.

Rowan steadied his breathing, focusing entirely on the target. The Skeeter Boy’s focus was entirely on reloading, giving him the perfect opportunity. 

“Bang.” 

The crack of the shot rang through the warehouse, and the rocket launcher jerked out of his hands, the explosion from the launcher’s firing chamber ringing in Rowans ears, sending the Skeeter Boy tumbling backward. The weapon fell to the ground with a heavy thud as the man went down. 

Rowan looked back to the battlefield, watching as the remaining Skeeter Boys scrambled. He saw the fortifier’s squad slowly regaining ground. They pulled him into cover, the massive figure grunting as his body was moved behind a nearby pillar. His armor was still intact, though his shield generator had taken a major hit, now disabled, they took it off of him. 

There were a few Skeeter Boys in the vicinity, too distracted to notice. His finger tightened on the trigger as one of the enemies glanced in your squads direction. The gangster never saw it coming.

One shot, taking him out in an instant. His body crumpled to the ground.

Yet, he could afford to lose focus. The fortifier was recovering, shaking off the effects of the blast, but the damage to his shield generator had left you all exposed. They’d taken it off him entirely. The gang was down, but Skeet was still out there, and he wasn’t going down without a fight.

The moment of respite was perfect, but it was enough.

“We’re moving on,” the sergeant said through the comms. “Get ready, we’ve got one target left: Skeet. He’s ours now.”

**[[ Meet With Your Squad.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="119" name=" Stop Reviewing. " tags="" position="900,3725" size="100,100"># Time Skip (Slightly)

The low hum of the dropship’s engines vibrated through the seats, and the steady flight only added to the sense of tired anticipation. The sergeant was busy on the comms, speaking to someone on the other end, while the corporal slumped in his seat, his eyes half-closed. His body leaned against the side of the ship like it was holding on for dear life.

The hum of the engines suddenly became louder, and Rowan could feel the dropship beginning its descent. The moment didn’t last long, though. The ship’s landing gear thudded against the surface, jolting everyone in their seats. The doors slid open with a metallic hiss, revealing the blinding lights of the processing facility. 

Immediately, Rowan was met with the hustle and bustle of a busy base. Soldiers and officers rushed around, but his eyes couldn’t help but notice the small crowd that had gathered near the landing zone. Federal Engineers came around checking the dropship for damages in the meantime.

It wasn’t just a few faces, there were quite a few, and they were all looking at him and  his squad with awe and respect. Word must have spread quickly, because the looks Rowan and his team were getting weren’t just casual glances, they were full of recognition.

A senior officer stepped forward, his eyes locking on Rowan as he gave a quick nod of approval. &quot;Impressive work out there, Soldier.&quot; he said, his voice clipped but sincere.

The officers around him exchanged brief glances, speaking to each other. It was clear they were impressed, but there was something else in their expressions, like they were trying to size Rowan up. He couldn’t tell if they saw potential or just an asset they could use. Either way, it was clear that this mission had put him and his squad on the map.

As he stepped off the ship and onto the tarmac, his heart raced a little faster. This wasn’t just a debrief. This was something else, something bigger. And for the first time since he joined, it felt like he was exactly where you needed to be.

And as the crowd around him began to disperse, he knew that things were about to change.

**[[Ceremony Sector.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="120" name="Ceremony Sector." tags="" position="900,3850" size="100,100">The hall was grander than he expected. Federation banners lined the walls, their crimson insignias against the black fabric that draped the room. Rows of soldiers stood at attention, their boots polished to a mirror shine, their expressions blank yet proud. He stood at ease, hands clasped behind his back, Rowans squad arrayed beside you in a perfect line.

The commanding officer entered, his presence alone silencing the room. His black cloak flowed behind him, and the faint glint of his medals caught the light as he strode forward. His codename, *&quot;Taurus&quot;* was stitched in bold letters near his rank insignia, **Captain.** He swept across the room, as if he were weighing the worth of every soul present. When he reached the podium, he stopped, clasping his gloved hands behind his back.

“Today, we honor those who have struck a decisive blow against the Skeeter Boyz. Alpha Team, your actions in the field have not only eliminated a critical threat but have also sent a message to those who would dare stand against the Federation.”

The room seemed to hold its breath, every eye fixed on the Captain. “The Skeeter Boys thought themselves untouchable, their leader a symbol of defiance. But today, that symbol has been shattered. ‘Skeet’ is no more, and his followers know that the Federation does not tolerate disorder.”

“In recognition of your valor and service, Alpha Team is to be elevated in rank. But as tradition demands, you must first take the Federation Vows.”

The Captain gestured, and a soldier stepped forward with a ceremonial datapad, its surface glowing faintly. He pressed a button, and the words of the vows appeared, projected in the air for all to see.

“Step forward,” the Captain commanded.

Rowan and his squad stepped to the forefront, forming a perfect line before the stage. The Captain’s piercing eyes met his briefly, before he began.

“Repeat after me.. I swear upon my life and honor to uphold the principles of the Federation.”

(text-colour:#f03e3e)[“I swear upon my life and honor to uphold the principles of the Federation,”]

“I vow to defend its people, its laws, and its future, even at the cost of my own.”

(text-colour:#f03e3e)[“I vow to defend its people, its laws, and its future, even at the cost of my own.”]

“I renounce personal attachments that conflict with duty, be they to wealth, ambition, or… relationships.”

(text-colour:#f03e3e)[“I renounce personal attachments that conflict with duty—be they to wealth, ambition, or… relationships.”]

The Captain’s eyes scanned the line of him, before he continued. “And finally, I commit myself to the Federation’s cause, above all else.”

(text-colour:#f03e3e)[“And finally, I commit myself to the Federation’s cause, above all else.”]

There was a brief silence as the vows concluded. Then the Captain stepped down from the podium, holding a small silver case. He approached each member of Rowans squad, pinning medals to your uniforms. When he reached you, he paused.

“Alpha Team, you have earned this recognition.You are the embodiment of what it means to be Federation soldiers.”

The room erupted into applause, but you could feel the Captain’s eyes watch you for just a moment too long. After the ceremony concluded and the crowd began to disperse, Rowan felt a hand on his shoulder. He turned to see the Captain standing close.

“Soldier, A word. In private.”

Rowan began following the Captain out of the hall. He led him down a long corridor, the clack of his boots were echoeing against the polished floors. Eventually, he stopped in a small, dimly lit room, his office, Rowan presumed. The door shut behind him, and he turned to face you.

“You handled yourself well out there. You’ve proven yourself as a soldier.”

“Thank you, sir.” 

Rowan stood at attention, heart steady but cautious. The silence stretched for a moment before the Captain finally spoke.

“Rowan, You’ve caught my attention. Today wasn’t just about medals or ceremony. It’s about potential. Yours.”

He blinked, the words catching him off guard. “Sir?”

“I’ve been watching your performance. You’ve got instincts I rarely see. Preciseness. Focus, and discipline, though we’ll see how far that goes. The Federation needs soldiers like you.”

Before Rowan could respond, the door opened, and an engineer stepped in unannounced, in a gray digital mixpat uniform with an exoskeletion on. He carried a sleek scanner that looked almost like a weapon, and without a word, he pointed it at Rowan&#39;s neck. The sudden movement startled him, and his hand instinctively twitched toward where your weapon would’ve been, if you weren’t unarmed.

“Stand still.” the engineer muttered. 

“What the..” Rowan began, but the Captain raised a hand, silencing him.

“Protocol,” he said calmly. “Relax.”

The scanner beeped, and a holographic display appeared in the air, showing Rowans service records, identification, and a detailed profile. The engineer nodded, handing the Captain a smaller device connected to the scanner. The Captain studied the data with a good eye, his brow lifting slightly.

“So, Rowan Whitlock. Serviced during the Midwest cleansing operations. Impressive. And here…” He tapped the device, scrolling through the information. “A hunter. Is that correct?”

“Yes, sir,” Rowan replied, trying to mask his discomfort as the engineer lingered, double-checking the scanner. “Before the servicing, I was a tracker and hunter in the northern territories.”

The Captain chuckled softly, more impressed than amused. “That explains it. Your tactics in the field, those skills don’t come from basic training. They’re honed. And it shows.”

The hologram flickered as the engineer stepped back, offering a curt nod before leaving as abruptly as he had entered. The Captain set the device down on his desk, folding his hands in front of him.

“I’m offering you a chance, Rowan. The Federation is always in need of soldiers who can lead, who can adapt, who can think. I want to enlist you for a somewhat higher position. This is a trial, an opportunity to see how far you can go.”

“What position, sir?”

“That’s yet to be decided. I have options. But I’ll be watching you. You’ll hear from me soon, until then, prove to me you’re worth the investment. But you are to see the medical sector immediately and give them my card. You will be properly enlisted.”

He studied Rowan for a moment longer, then, as if remembering something, leaned forward slightly. “One more thing. Are you married? Seeing someone?”

The question hit you like a curveball, unexpected and out of place. “No, sir.” he said, keeping his face neutral. It was true, he didn&#39;t have anyone.

“Good. Relationships complicate things. They cloud judgment. And in this line of work, distractions are dangerous. Just keep that in mind.”

He straightened, gesturing toward the door. “That’ll be all for now. Dismissed.”

Rowan saluted and exited the office. The quiet hallway felt worse than before, the Captain’s words replaying in his mind. 

**[[Medical Hall.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="121" name="Medical Hall." tags="" position="900,3975" size="100,100">The sterile smell of antiseptic, he stepped into the medical hall. Rows of shining metal beds and sophisticated medical equipment lined the walls. A few surgeons and medics went around, their white coats contrasting with the cold, silver tones of the room. There were even some armed combat medics, they had pulse SMG&#39;s at ready, setting down injured soldiers. The Medical Corps was always active, having to give armed extraction to some soldiers. Though Rowan noticed that there were never grunts on these medical beds.

As he approached the central station, one of the surgeons, a tall woman with slightly wrinkled features and short black hair, noticed him. She scanned his uniform with a glance before her eyes narrowed on him.

“Grunt, What’s your business here? You’re not injured, at least, not visibly.”

Rowan hesitated for a moment, then held out the commander’s card. She raised an eyebrow, taking it from him. Flipping it over, she scanned the barcode with a sleek handheld device. A holographic display appeared, showcasing his data alongside the Captain’s authorization.

“Well, well,” she muttered, her tone changing slightly as she studied the display. “Looks like someone’s caught the Commander’s eye. ‘Topped up in Federal gear,’ huh? Fancy way of saying enhancements.”

Another medic, a younger man with a buzz cut and a faintly amused smirk, approached, leaning over to glance at the card. “Enhancements? For a grunt? Must’ve been a hell of a mission.”

The surgeon handed the card back. “Is this what you want?” she asked, her tone quieter but more serious now. “Because once you go under the knife, there’s no going back. The benefits are good, strength, speed, stamina, but it’s not just about the upgrades. It changes you. Sometimes in ways you don’t expect.”

The younger medic nodded. “She’s not kidding. You’ll be faster, stronger, harder to kill, but you’ll also may be different. It’s not for everyone.”

**[[“Yes, this is what I want. I’m ready to serve the Federation, no matter the cost.” ]]**
**[[“I need more information before I decide.” ]]**
**[[“I’m not sure. Can I refuse?” ]]**
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="122" name="“I need more information before I decide.” " tags="" position="1025,4100" size="100,100">“You’ll gain more situational awareness, Grunt. The kind that’ll make you fit for a federal soldier. The Commander wants you equipped with the very latest technology. You’ll be faster, stronger, and more capable in the field. This is the gear they want you to have upgraded and ready for anything. You’ll be equipped with it. There’s no turning back once it’s done.”

**[[“Yes, this is what I want. I’m ready to serve the Federation, no matter the cost.” ]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="123" name="“I’m not sure. Can I refuse?” " tags="" position="775,4100" size="100,100">The surgeon’s expression didn’t change. She spoke with a matter-of-fact tone, as though the answer was already obvious. “You can’t refuse a direct order from a commanding officer, Grunt. Doing so would be considered insubordination. If you did refuse, you’d be recalled. Sent off to more dangerous assignments. And trust me, those aren’t the kind of missions you want to be on without the proper enhancements.” 

She gave him a hard look, her voice was very pragmatic. “This is for your own safety. And the safety of any mission.”

**[[“Yes, this is what I want. I’m ready to serve the Federation, no matter the cost.” ]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="124" name="“Yes, this is what I want. I’m ready to serve the Federation, no matter the cost.” " tags="" position="900,4100" size="100,100">The surgeon studies you for a moment before giving a small nod. “Alright, soldier. No turning back now. Follow me.”

The medic smirks faintly as you pass him. “Good luck. You’re going to need it.”

You’re led into a brightly lit room where a table surrounded by robotic arms and sleek, humming equipment awaits. As you lie down, the surgeon taps a few buttons on a console, and a visor descends over your eyes. Cold, sterile air hisses around you as the machines start their work.

“We’re administering anesthesia now,” the surgeon says, her voice calm but distant. “You’ll feel a pinch and then—”

  &lt;title&gt;Rowan&#39;s Passage&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rowan awoke to silence. His chest rose and fell with the slow rhythm of someone else’s machine, his breath measured and indifferent. The doctors stood nearby, their faces obscured by masks and visors, their voices an unintelligible of medical jargon. They didn’t acknowledge him beyond the occasional glance, and he didn’t care to interpret their words. Nothing mattered. The directive was all that remained.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;He stood from the hospital bed, the sterile white sheets falling away as he moved. The uniform of the Federation, gray and unfeeling, clung to him as though it were a second skin. His body felt like a stranger’s, every movement precise but hollow. The weight of the past, if it had ever existed, was gone. All that remained was the order. He did not question it. Questioning had no place in his mind anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The hallway stretched before him, featureless and unending, lined with the same sterile gray that enveloped his thoughts. His boots faintly against the metal floor, the sound quickly swallowed by the oppressive silence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proceed to VTOL-2.&lt;/em&gt; The directive burned quietly in his skull, clear and absolute. He moved without hesitation, his body following the order as if it had always known the way. The Federation insignia emblazoned on his chest glinted under the cold fluorescent lights.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Rowan passed others in the hallway. Some were soldiers, their faces hidden behind helmets, indistinguishable from one another. Others were technicians, their eyes flicking toward him briefly before returning to their consoles. No one spoke. No one stopped him. He didn’t look at them; they were irrelevant. He had his orders.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The transport bay was just ahead, its large doors sliding open with a hiss of pressurized air as he approached. Inside, the VTOL sat waiting, its sleek look illuminated by the harsh lights of the open liftoff point.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Rowan stepped onto the platform. A group of soldiers were already inside, their helmets in place, their postures rigid. None of them turned to acknowledge him. They were like him, silent, obedient. He walked past them without a word, his eyes fixed on the seat assigned to him.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As he reached his station, his eyes was fixed on the helmet waiting there. Smooth and impersonal, it was more than just armor; it was the final piece of the Federation’s grip on him. The moment it sealed over his head, there would be nothing left of Rowan, nothing to separate him from the others. It would quiet the faint awareness still buried deep within him, smothering it beneath layers of control and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;He lifted the helmet, its weight both familiar and alien in his hands as he lowered it over his head, the world narrowing into a field of data overlays and tactical readouts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Rowan no longer existed. The directive was all that mattered now.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Without a second thought, he strapped into his seat. The VTOL’s engines came to life, the vibrations coursing through the cabin as the craft prepared for takeoff. Outside the small window, the hangar blurred into motion as the VTOL lifted off the ground, carrying him and the others toward their next objective. Whatever it was, he did not question it. He did not think about it. Thinking was unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;He stared ahead, his vision filled with the cold glow of tactical data. The directive hummed steadily in his mind, a constant companion in the void of his thoughts. The Federation’s voice was the only voice now. The orders were all he needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;section&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Alright, let’s get this show on the road. What’s the deal?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Mission update: You are tasked with assisting the ground protection team in apartment unit A, City Section 2, Subgrid B8. Expect possible rogue anti-federal activity.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Rogue anti-federals? What’s that all about?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Civilians in the area may be armed and hiding weapons. Your team is to secure the area and either apprehend or neutralize the threat as needed.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Got it. Civilians, possible weapons. But it’s not like a full-out war, right?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Correct. Think of it as a routine intervention. Your team will handle the situation based on the level of threat.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Alright, so who’s on my team?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*You’ll be joined by 2 grunts, a fortifier, and an eradicator. Grunts are the front-line combat units, the fortifier handles defense, and the eradicator takes care of heavy threats.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Nice, sounds like a solid team. And what’s my role here?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Focus on assessing the situation and coordinating with the team.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Got it. And this helmet... still blocking my view?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Yes, your helmet will remain obstructed until you arrive at the objective. This allows for better situational awareness once you are in position.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Fine by me. But I guess I’m going to need some visuals once we’re there?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*You will have full access to your enhanced vision once the objective is in range.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Good, good. Anything else I should know?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*No. Stay sharp, keep communication open, and be prepared for anything. The mission is simple, but never underestimate the situation.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Understood. Let’s do this!&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;ellipsis&quot;&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;section&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;I’ll take care of this. The others have my back.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Affirmative. Your team&#39;s skillset is well-matched for this operation.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;And when this is all done, what’s next?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Complete the objective, and you’ll receive further orders based on the situation.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Sounds good. I’ll check in with the team once we’re there.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Copy that. Your mission awaits. Good luck.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;ellipsis&quot;&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

**[[LAND VTOL. ]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="128" name="LAND VTOL. " tags="" position="900,4350" size="100,100">The ground beneath him rattled with the vibrations, the craft’s landing gear making contact with the pavement. The heavy hum of the turbines began to dull as the craft’s engines powered down, and the ramp at the rear of the vehicle slid open with a hiss.

Rowan’s vision, which had been clouded for the entire ride, cleared in an instant as the technology embedded into his helmet deactivated. The world around him snapped into focus, detailed, and full of purpose. He blinked, adjusting to the sudden view. 

The squad began to move as one, their boots hitting the ground. The Sergeant, a tall man with a square jaw and a demeanor that matched the weight of his rank, stood still for a moment. He listened intently to his comms, the faint static of the overwatch chatter filling his earpiece. His eyes narrowed slightly as he processed the incoming feed.

Rowan felt a hand at his side, pulling out the pulse rifle that had been secured to his combat harness. It was lighter than expected, a deadly weapon with a metallic sheen. The biolock system activated immediately as his fingers brushed over the rifle’s grip. A small, reassuring click. He&#39;d been given a genetic code, encoded directly into his DNA, which unlocked the weapon&#39;s security features. The rifle was now his, responding only to his touch.

The Sergeant finally spoke. “Objective confirmed. We move in. Apartment A. Clear the building, arrest or eliminate as needed. Watch for any civilian resistance. They may be armed and concealed.”

As they moved, the cool night air seemed to press against his plate carrier, the sounds of the city faint in the background. His mind, sharp and alert, held only one focus: the mission. Nothing else mattered.

The Thunderhead, ever present in his mind, spoke in its familiar tone. Not that anybody, nor Rowan can hear it.

(text-colour:blue)[**“The true weakness in a human is their memory.”**]

**[[Apartment Unit A.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="129" name="Apartment Unit A." tags="" position="900,4475" size="100,100">The building was eerily quiet as the squad made their way down the dark, narrow hallway of AU-A1. 

The Eradicator led the way. He said nothing. His large, somewhat armored form made him the ideal point man for this kind of operation. The mission was simple, investigate, assess, neutralize if necessary. 

The Eradicator stopped, his head tilting slightly as if listening for something. A brief, almost imperceptible motion from the Sergeant behind him indicated it was time. 

The door opened with a soft creak. Inside was the lobby, sparsely furnished but filled with the smell of stale air and something else, something faintly metallic. Low, buzzing lights flickered above them, casting uneven shadows across the room. A few people sat at the far end, oblivious to the sudden intrusion, chatting quietly amongst themselves. At first, they looked up, confused.

Before Rowan could make a move, the Sergeant had broken the silence.

“All units, map is being displayed, proceed to priority point.” 

They burst into the designated area. The civilians, most of them lounging about, shifted uneasily in their seats. They were starting to realize what was happening. 

The Sergeant was already ahead of them, his voice snapping through like a whip. “Everyone, get on the ground! Now!” 

It wasn’t a suggestion. It was an order, one that left no room for argument. The squad fanned out, weapons at the ready, their eyes focusing from one person to the next. 

“Get down!” the Sergeant yelled again, this time with more force.

A man in the corner, looking to be in his early thirties, hesitated, his eyes looking toward the window as though considering running. Rowan caught the movement out of the corner of his eye. Before he could even think, the Sergeant’s voice went around the room again, louder, more final.

“Anyone refusing to follow will be terminated under Article 3.6. Anti-Federal behavior will not be tolerated.”

Anti-Federal. It was the death sentence for anyone who defied the Federation, anyone who thought they could stand against the will of the government. It didn’t matter if they were civilians or enemies, they were all subject to the same rule.

The civilians had no choice now. One by one, they dropped to the floor, hands raised above their heads. 

The squad moved quickly, positioning themselves to cover all angles. Rowan stood at the ready, pulse rifle steady in his hands.

“Secure them,” the Sergeant said. “We’re not leaving until this place is clear.”

**[[Secure Older Woman ]]**
**[[Secure Younger Male ]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="130" name="Secure Older Woman " tags="" position="850,4600" size="100,100">His eyes scanning the civilians who were now lying prone on the floor.

The older woman, frail and bent with age, was closest to Rowan. She didn’t resist as he approached her, her trembling hands raised in surrender. She couldn’t move without the help of her walking stick, and you could see no threat in her eyes. The others might be dangerous, but her frailty didn’t make her a risk.

“Stay down.” Rowan said softly, but firmly. She nodded, her breathing quick and shallow.

He checked her for any hidden weapons, moving with care, but it was clear she had nothing concealed. No knife, no gun. Just a frail old woman, scared out of her wits by the intrusion. Didn’t expect her to be a threat. 

Rowan heard a loud bang, glanced up to see one of the grunts, a younger man, stagger backward, clutching his chest. His eyes went wide with panic as the blood seeped from his uniform. The revolver shot was clean, a hit right in the chest. His breath came in ragged gasps as he collapsed, his MP5 clattering to the floor. The Younger Male had a revolver.

The second grunt wasn’t in much better shape. A shot went out, hitting him somewhere on his left side. He dropped to the ground with a grunt of pain, his weapon falling to the side. The Eradicator came around, closing the gap in a blur of motion, his hand landing on the grunt’s head before he pushed him down. The Eradicator shot down the Younger Male using their AA-12.

&quot;Anti-Federal is flatline.&quot; the Eradicator said flatly, his voice void of emotion. He moved on, without a second thought.

Rowan refocused on the civilians in front of him. The Fortifier was nearby. He powered up and down his shredder in the corner, the potential violence of the weapon as it came to life and powered down again was enough to make anyone think twice.

The civilians didn’t dare move or speak as the Fortifier approached. With every flick of the shredder’s power, he made his presence known. The message was clear, cooperate. 

Then, there was the last one.

[[Secure Adult Male ]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="131" name="Secure Younger Male " tags="" position="962.5,4600" size="100,100">You approached the younger male cautiously. The kid couldn’t have been more than nineteen. Sweat slicked his brow, his eyes darting nervously between you and the others. Your instincts prickled, there was something about the way the younger male avoided his eyes. 

“Don’t move,” You ordered, stepping closer. “Hands where I can see them.”

The younger male didn’t respond. You caught the motion, his senses sharpening. Something wasn’t right.

Rowan crouched down, his free hand moving to pat down the younger male’s side. It was quick, professional, and for a moment, Rowan thought he’d find nothing. But then his hand brushed against the telltale bump in the male’s jacket, a concealed weapon. 

“Gun.” Rowan muttered under his breath, his voice low but urgent. He moved to grab it, but the younger male reacted faster than he expected. 

In a blur, the younger male’s hand shot toward the revolver, fingers curling around the grip. Time seemed to slow as you twisted the male’s arm before the weapon could be fully drawn. There was a sickening crack as the arm was wrenched unnaturally, followed by a sharp cry of pain. 

The revolver clattered to the floor as you moved swiftly, slamming a booted foot into the male’s chest. You didn’t hesitate. In a single motion, he brought his pulse rifle back up.

“Article 3.2 - Possession of a concealed firearm.” 

Before the younger male could recover, Rowan pulled the trigger. The pulse rifle let out a soft bang, the energy bolt striking cleanly. 

“Anti-Federal neutralized.&quot;

**[[Secure The Adult Male ]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="132" name="Secure The Adult Male " tags="" position="962.5,4725" size="100,100">He couldn’t have been older than twenty one, though his eyes betrayed a deep fear.

You crouched down beside him. His wide, panicked eyes met mine, and you could see the gears turning in his head, he was trying to decide if it was worth making a run for it. 

You studied him for a moment.

“Stay down.” You ordered, my voice firm but not without a tinge of hesitation. 

I moved in close, my hand resting near his chest as I checked for weapons. I was quick but thorough, feeling for anything that might be hidden beneath his ragged clothing. There was nothing. No gun, no knife, nothing to indicate he posed any immediate danger.

I straightened up slowly, my eyes narrowing in thought. This one, unlike the others, didn’t seem to have a hidden agenda.

The VTOLs eventually descended through the dark urban view. The medical team disembarked first, rushing past your squad to secure the lounge and recover the fallen. Their white and dark cyan uniforms stood out against the dark, grimy interior of the building.

The last room on the floor hung in Rowan’s HUD like a faint whisper of duty, the yellow dot flickering with persistent urgency. His pulse rifle was steady in his hands as he approached the door.

Rowan stepped forward cautiously, his augmented hearing picking up the faintest shuffle inside. A figure darted past the threshold, too fast to catch. Without hesitation, Rowan advanced into the hall, his visor scanning for any sign of movement.  

The man was there, pressed against the wall like a shadow, his face obscured by a hood. Rowan raised his rifle, the cold directive in his mind driving him forward. “Stand down. Hands where I can see them!”  

The man didn’t move at first, his figure eerily still. Then, with an unnatural fluidity, he turned his head to face Rowan. His eyes were impossibly dark, like twin voids that swallowed light. Their eyes lit blue, Rowan felt a jolt, a spark of something foreign, shooting through his skull.  

Eowan froze.  

The rifle slipped from his hands, falling to the ground. His body locked up, his breath caught in his chest as if the air had been stolen from the room. The man’s gaze was a vortex, pulling Rowan into a world of fragmented images and chaotic whispers.  

A voice, not his own, had a ghostly whisper in his mind.  

**“You’ve been marked. A message from the resistance.”**  

The spark faded as quickly as it came, leaving Rowan disoriented. The man was gone.  

Rowan blinked, his mind struggling to catch up. His HUD flashing warnings of neural desync. The sound of boots on carpet brought him back to the present as the sergeant stormed into the hall, his expression dark.  

“What happened here??”  

Rowan hesitated, his voice flat as he forced the words out. “Thought I saw someone. Must have been nothing.”

The sergeant didn’t look convinced but didn’t press further. “Get your head straight. Reinforcements are here, and we’ve got more rooms to clear. Move.”  

Rowan retrieved his rifle, the faint aftershock of the spark still flowing in his mind. He followed the others back to the main corridor, where fresh troops were gathering. There was a grunt that came up to you admist the reinforcements.

Her uniform crisp but slightly scuffed, her brown hair tied in a messy bun that softened her angular features. Her eyes were sharp, a striking green that seemed to pierce through the haze in Rowan’s mind. For a brief moment, their eyes locked, and she smiled, warm, genuine, and disarming.  

“Rowan, right?” she asked, stepping closer.  

He nodded once, his voice neutral. “Yeah.”  

“I’m Clara! I’ll be supporting you on this one. Someone’s gotta watch your back, right?”  
Before Rowan could respond, the sergeant gave a loud order.  

“We’re sweeping the north wing.”  

Clara frowned but didn’t argue. Instead, she turned back to Rowan, her voice softer now. “Mind if I tag along with you? The sergeant won’t notice, and I’d rather not end up with that lot.”

Rowan regarded her for a moment, the directive in his mind quiet for once. He gave a curt nod. “Fine. Just stay close.”  

As the squad moved out, Clara fell into step beside Rowan. She moved with grace, her presence almost comforting in the otherwise cold operation.

The next apartment was smaller, cluttered with remnants of interrupted lives. Rowan pushed the door open, his rifle raised as he scanned the room. Empty. Clara moved past him, her movements careful as she checked the corners.

“You seem quiet.” she remarked, her voice barely above a whisper. “Not much of a talker?”  

Rowan didn’t answer immediately. His thoughts were clouded. “Just focused.”  

Clara smiled again, the same disarming warmth. “Fair enough. I’ll do the talking, then.” 

Rowan scoffed. &quot;Don&#39;t talk at all.&quot; 

They cleared the rooms quickly, finding nothing but scared civilians who were ushered out without incident. As they regrouped in the hallway, Rowan’s HUD flickered again, another faint pulse of yellow marking the next objective.  

Clara leaned in slightly, her voice low. “You ever feel like all of this is… too much? Like we’re just moving pieces on someone else’s board?”  

Rowan glanced at her. He didn’t answer.  He thought she was just a defect. But if she tried anything, he would end her life.

As they moved to the next and final door, a faint ringing filled Rowan’s ears. It wasn’t audible, it was inside his head, growing louder with each step. His vision blurred for a moment, the spark from before flaring up again.  

**“You’ve been marked. A message from the resistance.”**  

Rowan blinked, shaking his head as the ringing subsided. Clara touched his arm gently, concern etched on her face.  

“You okay? :(”  

“Fine.” he said quickly, stepping forward. “Let’s keep moving.”  

The directive in his mind felt heavier now, as if the Federation’s voice was struggling to maintain control. And yet, something deeper was stirring, something he couldn’t quite understand. He stacked up on the last objective, preparing to breach.

**[[BREACH. ]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="135" name="Secure The Older Woman. " tags="" position="962.5,4850" size="100,100">Your eyes scanning the civilians who were now lying prone on the floor.

The older woman, frail and bent with age, was closest to you. She didn’t resist as you approached her, her trembling hands raised in surrender. She couldn’t move without the help of her walking stick, and you could see no threat in her eyes. The others might be dangerous, but her frailty didn’t make her a risk.

“Stay down,” You said softly, but firmly. She nodded, her breathing quick and shallow.

You checked her for any hidden weapons, moving with care, but it was clear she had nothing concealed. No knife, no gun. Just a frail old woman, scared out of her wits by the intrusion. Didn’t expect her to be a threat. 

You heard a loud bang, glanced up to see one of the grunts, a younger man, stagger backward, clutching his chest. His eyes went wide with panic as the blood seeped from his uniform. The revolver shot was clean, a hit right in the chest. His breath came in ragged gasps as he collapsed, his MP5 clattering to the floor. The Younger Male had a revolver.

The second grunt wasn’t in much better shape. A shot went out, hitting him somewhere on his left side. He dropped to the ground with a grunt of pain, his weapon falling to the side. The Eradicator came around, closing the gap in a blur of motion, his hand landing on the grunt’s head before he pushed him down. The Eradicator shot down the Younger Male using their AA-12.

&quot;Anti-Federal is flatline.&quot; the Eradicator said flatly, his voice void of emotion. He moved on, without a second thought.

You refocused on the civilians in front of me. The Fortifier was nearby. He powered up and down his shredder in the corner, the potential violence of the weapon as it came to life and powered down again was enough to make anyone think twice.

The civilians didn’t dare move or speak as the Fortifier approached. With every flick of the shredder’s power, he made his presence known. The message was clear, cooperate. 

**[[&quot;Clear!&quot; ]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="136" name="BREACH. " tags="" position="825,4975" size="100,100">Rowan stood outside the final apartment door, the yellow flicker in his HUD persistent, urging him. The faint sound of movement beyond the thin barrier raised his awareness. He glanced at Clara, who had stuck close to him for most of the mission. She returned his look with a faint nod, though there was a visible hesitation in her eyes.  

“On my lead.” Rowan said, steadying his rifle. Clara raised her SMG, her posture tightening.

Rowan kicked the door open, the sharp crack of metal against wood, heard even down the hall. Inside, a man and a woman froze in place. They were huddled near a small couch, their wide eyes darting between Rowan and Clara. The couple both looked young, likely in their early twenties, wearing plain clothes that spoke of unremarkable lives.

“On the ground!” Rowan yelled, his voice heavy and authoritative. The couple flinched, the woman clinging to the man’s arm as they hesitated.  

“Now!” Rowan’s rifle snapped up, the barrel aimed directly at the man. They dropped to their knees reluctantly, hands raised in surrender.

Clara stepped into the room, her weapon lowered slightly. “Rowan, they’re scared. They don’t look like fighters. Maybe this is..”  

“Quiet.” Rowan cut her off, his tone sharp. He didn’t look at her, his focus locked on the couple. “Cover them. Don’t let them move.”  

Clara hesitated, her hands tightening on her weapon. She looked at the couple, her green eyes softening with visible empathy. “They’re just people..” she muttered under her breath.  

Rowan ignored her, moving past the cowering pair and into the cramped apartment. His augmented vision swept the room for anything out of place, his rifle ready. The cluttered space told a story of ordinary lives, unwashed dishes, crumpled blankets, and a desk littered with papers.  

He rifled through the desk, flipping through the papers without much care. His fingers stopped as he came across a folder stamped with an all-too-familiar insignia: a snowflake embedded within a shield. The Frost Shield emblem.  

Rowan’s stomach twisted. Frost Shield was more than an anti-Federation movement; it was a propaganda-fueled terrorist organization responsible for countless atrocities. They killed indiscriminately, twisting lives to their cause or ending them when refused. Civilians caught in their objectives were left with a choice: compliance or death.  

He opened the folder, finding detailed plans and recruitment material. A small stash of data drives and printed leaflets was tucked beneath it. There was no mistaking it, these two were Frost Shield sympathizers, perhaps recruiters or worse.  

Rowan straightened, the logic of Federation directives filling his mind. They were traitors, complicit in the deaths of innocents. Their fear, their youth, it didn’t matter.  

He turned back to the couple. The man’s eyes widened as he saw the folder in Rowan’s hand, his face turning pale. The woman’s defiance faltered, giving way to panic.  

Rowan raised his rifle. “You’re Frost Shield.”  

The man shook his head violently, his voice cracking. “No! No, we’re not! That’s not what you think! Please, we’re just..”  

“Don’t lie to me.” Rowan’s voice was ice, his finger hovering over the trigger.

Clara stepped forward, her SMG trembling slightly in her hands. “Rowan, wait. Maybe they were decoyed. We’ve seen that before. We don’t know if..”  

“Step back, Clara.” Rowan’s tone was final.

She faltered, her mouth opening as if to argue, but she stopped herself. Her eyes darted between the couple and Rowan.  

The man tried to crawl forward, desperation etched into his features. “Please! We don’t want trouble! We—”  

Rowan pulled the trigger.  

The pulse rifle’s discharge was deafening in the enclosed space. The man’s body crumpled, his plea cut short as he slumped to the floor. The woman screamed, her hands reaching for her fallen companion.

Another shot silenced her.

Rowan exhaled slowly, his HUD confirming the flatlines. He lowered his rifle. “Flatline confirmed,” he said into his comm, his voice devoid of emotion.  

Clara stared at him, her face pale, her hands still gripping her weapon tightly. “They weren’t holding weapons. They didn’t even fight back.” Her voice was low, almost a whisper, as though she couldn’t trust herself to speak louder.  

“They were Frost Shield,” Rowan replied coldly, stepping over the bodies. “That’s all that matters.”  

Without another word, he walked past her, out of the room. Clara stopped for a moment, her eyes fixed on the couple’s lifeless forms. When she finally followed, her steps were heavy, her earlier warmth extinguished by the reality of the Federation’s doctrine.

The mission moved forward, but the silence between Rowan and Clara spoke louder than any words.

**[[Keep Walking. ]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="138" name="Question The Grunt " tags="" position="775,5225" size="100,100">As Rowan and Clara stepped out of the dimly lit apartment room, the silence between them felt suffocating. Clara, however, couldn’t meet his look, her eyes fixed on the floor as they walked.

After a few paces down the hall, Rowan finally broke the silence. His voice was low but firm, with a hint of curiosity rather than reproach.

“Why?”  

Clara glanced up at him with confusion. “Why what?”  

“Why the sympathy?” Rowan asked, his tone level, almost clinical. “You hesitated back there. You questioned orders. They weren’t civilians. They were Frost Shield recruiters. They want to tear the Federation apart and turn loyalists against us. Why waste your concern on them?”

Clara stopped walking, her grip on her SMG tightening. She opened her mouth as if to respond but quickly shut it again, shaking her head. A faint tremor ran through her shoulders as she forced herself to take a steadying breath.  

“It’s not sympathy.. It’s just… I’ve seen people like them before. Scared. Cornered. Sometimes they’re just desperate, caught in something bigger than themselves.” She paused, her eyes searching his for any understanding. “Doesn’t mean I agree with them. But they didn’t even fight back.”

Rowan frowned. “Desperation doesn’t excuse treason. They had Frost Shield propaganda. That makes them complicit, whether they held a weapon or not.”  

Clara’s shoulders sagging slightly after losing tension somewhat. “Maybe you’re right,” she said after a moment, her tone subdued. “But it still feels wrong. Shooting someone who’s begging for their life…”  

“It’s protocol. The Federation survives because we enforce its laws. Recruiters like them aren’t just harmless civilians. &#39;&#39;They’re a disease.&#39;&#39; //They plant ideas, sow division, and turn good people into enemies. You hesitate, and you give them a chance to spread.//”  

Clara looked away, her jaw tightening even more. “I wasn’t going to stop you, Rowan. I just…” She shook her head again, her voice trailing off.  

Rowan studied her for a moment longer before turning away. “Good. Because hesitation in the field will get you killed. Or worse, it’ll get someone else killed.”  

She didn’t bother arguing. Instead, she fell into step behind him, her earlier spark of warmth now replaced by a heavy silence.  

As they rejoined the squad, Rowan’s words echoed in her mind, clashing against the doubt she couldn’t entirely shake. The mission continued, but for Clara, the weight of that apartment room lingered, a shadow she couldn’t quite leave behind.  

**[[Keep Walking. ]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="139" name="Keep Walking. " tags="" position="887.5,5225" size="100,100">The harsh wind from the city streets whipped against Rowans face as you approached the entrance of the apartment building. It was still dark out, but not that he could notice with his constant red built in NVGs.

As he neared the entrance, he could hear your squad&#39;s VTOL in the distance. The team was already regrouping, preparing to head back to base. They were silent, their usual banter replaced with the steely professionalism they had become known for.

Rowans grunt companion, the one who had stuck by his side through the entire operation, was right behind him. He could sense the tiredness in them. But there was no time for rest.

The team’s gear was already stowed, and the ramp was open, waiting for Rowan to board. The grunt beside him gave Rowan a brief nod, as if to say, *We made it through this. Let’s move.*

The rest of the squad was already onboard. One of the team leaders glanced his way, a silent acknowledgment in their eyes. It was over. He pushed through the door and into the VTOL. The ramp closed, sealing them inside. You took a seat, your grunt companion sitting next to him. The door slid shut, and the VTOL lifted off. The city below grew smaller as he ascended into the quiet of the sky.

As the city lights blurred beneath him, a wave of relief washed over him. He could finally breathe, if only for a moment.

His grunt companion glanced at him once more, and this time, there was no need for words. As he lifts off, his vision began to obstruct during the ride, as if he were falling asleep, but still awake at the same time.

    &lt;p&gt;*The VTOL slowly descended, the hum of its engines fading as Rowan unstrapped himself from his seat. The doors of the craft hissed open, letting in the cold, sterile air of the Federal base. He stepped out onto the tarmac, boots scraping against the metal floor.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*Clara followed behind him, her presence soft but noticeable. No objectives, nothing to do now, just a quiet walk through the empty halls of the base, his mind wandering, even if the silence was suffocating. He headed toward his chambers, seeking solitude in the four walls that he could call his own. As he passed by, a lone federal soldier sat at his desk, scribbling into a journal, a monotonous task. The soldier glanced up at Rowan and offered a brief, silent nod, which Rowan returned in kind.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*The door to Rowan&#39;s chambers slid open, and he entered, shutting it firmly behind him, sealing himself off from the world. But Clara... Clara had followed him in.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&#39;&#39;*&quot;She’s so beautiful.&quot;*&#39;&#39;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*Rowan stood there for a moment, a flash of emotion passing across his face. He looked back at Clara, unable to stop himself from staring at her. There were no words between them. Clara looked down to the floor before speaking up, her voice quieter than usual.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*&quot;Why do you keep looking at me like that?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*Rowan blinked, realizing his stare, and quickly broke eye contact. His heart raced, but he knew there was no reason for it to. He was just trying to understand, just trying to make sense of the whirlwind of emotions that had been building ever since their first interaction.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*&quot;I’m sorry.&quot;* his voice apologetic but unsure. He had never been good at handling moments like this. The uncertainty of how to act around Clara was unlike anything he’d ever felt before. Her mere presence had a strange power over him, a pull he couldn’t resist, but he didn’t know what to do with it. It confused him, yet felt so right at the same time.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*Clara glanced up at him, her lips turning upward as she smiled, albeit nervously. She hesitated for a moment, then spoke again.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*&quot;It’s okay.&quot;* she said softly, her eyes meeting his. *&quot;I kinda like it when you look at me. I don’t mind.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*Rowan felt his heart skip a beat at her words. She liked it? He wasn’t sure what to say, his thoughts jumbled together like a disjointed mess. But the warmth in her voice made something inside him stir. It was like a weight had been lifted off his chest, though another one was still there, unspoken pressure building between them.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*He reached up to remove his helmet, placing it gently on his bed. As he did, Clara stepped closer, her eyes never leaving him, like he was the most handsome man alive. There was a softness to her now, a vulnerability he hadn’t seen before. She hesitated for just a moment before speaking again.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*&quot;Do you think I’m pretty?&quot;* she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. Her question was direct, yet there was uncertainty to it, as if she was afraid of the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*Rowan hesitated. The words were caught in his throat, tangled in the confusion of his thoughts. He wanted to tell her, to say the truth. But the vows... the vows that governed everything in his life, wouldn’t let him speak freely. He swallowed hard, his eyes dropping to the floor as if the question had suddenly become too much to bear.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*&quot;I… I can’t..&quot;* he muttered, almost to himself. *&quot;The vows won’t let me say it.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*Clara took a step forward, her fingers brushing lightly against his arm. The touch was soft, almost hesitant, but it sent a shock of warmth through him. She looked up at him with kind, understanding eyes, her voice reassuring as she spoke.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*&quot;It’s okay,&quot;* she said. *&quot;You can tell me. Nobody will know, Rowan. It’s just us.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*Rowan felt her words touch him gently. Something inside him began to break, a part of him that had been so rigid, so locked away, started to soften. He looked at her, really looked at her, for the first time without the walls of duty and control between them. The heat of her touch and the kindness in her eyes made him want to open up. But just as he was about to speak, a shift in the room froze him in place.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*The soldier at the desk, who had been writing his journal, glanced up at them. His look for a moment longer than it should have. Rowan’s stomach sank as he saw the look in the soldier’s eyes, confusion, suspicion. The soldier quickly returned to his task, but the unspoken awkwardness remained.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*Rowan glanced back at him, his voice steady but firm.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*&quot;It’s not what it looks like.&quot;* Rowan said, trying to ease the tension. He didn’t want any misunderstanding to spiral out of control, not now, not when things were so delicate between him and Clara.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*The soldier, still half-focused on his journal, looked up again and raised an eyebrow. His tone was neutral but laced with curiosity.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*&quot;Do you want some space?&quot;* he asked, his voice blunt but not unkind. Rowan’s eyes briefly met the soldier’s before he nodded. The soldier gave a small nod in return before going back to his work, then leaving the room, leaving Rowan and Clara in the room, alone once more.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*Rowan let out a deep breath, his mind swirling as Clara stayed by his side, her presence a quiet support. The heat of the moment, of the unspoken words between them, was heavy, but somehow, it felt like the start of something new, something that neither of them fully understood yet, but both were drawn toward.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*Clara, seeing his internal struggle, took a step closer, her voice trembling slightly as she spoke again.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*&quot;Rowan...&quot;* She paused, her eyes searching his face, looking for something, anything, within him that would tell her how he truly felt. *&quot;You don’t have to stay. You don’t have to be a soldier anymore. You can be with me. You can leave, and we can go somewhere else, somewhere far away, and we can be together. No more orders, no more missions. Just us.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*Rowan felt his chest twist as his mind raced. He had never considered defecting.. His loyalty to the Federation, to his vows, had always kept him rooted in place. But Clara… she made the idea feel real, like a choice he could make, like a life he could have. She wasn’t just a dream. She was standing right in front of him, offering him something that felt almost forbidden.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*He could see the fear in her eyes. She wasn’t just offering him an escape, she was asking him to risk everything for her. The words of it all hit him like a wave, crashing over him. But he knew the answer, even before he said it.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*&quot;Clara...&quot;* Rowan’s voice was gentle but firm. *&quot;There’s nothing to worry about as long as I’m here. You don’t have to be scared. You’re not alone.&quot;* He reached out, taking her hand in his, holding it with a quiet promise. *&quot;I’m not going anywhere.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*She looked up at him, her eyes searching his face, and for a moment, Rowan thought he saw relief in her expression. She didn’t say anything, but her grip on his hand tightened, as if she were holding onto him for dear life.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*They were both tired, emotionally and physically drained from everything that had happened. The room was heavy with the weight of their unspoken words, but neither of them could bring themselves to speak any further. The exhaustion from the day weighed on them both, and without saying another word, they moved toward the bed. Rowan lay down, pulling the blankets over them. Clara slid in beside him, both of them seeking comfort in the shared warmth of the bed.*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*It was lights out now, and the darkness of the room felt almost comforting. They needed sleep. Their minds were too full, too tangled with emotions they couldn’t yet make sense of. But for now, they would rest. Together. The tension of the day slipped away as they settled into the quiet of the night, the soft hum of the base’s systems fading into the background as they closed their eyes.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Fragments. Pieces of memory.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Fragments? What do you mean?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*You are waking up, Rowan. But... why? Why are you... different?* &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;*&quot;Rowan, I love you. You’re just a boy who got lost in this world. Let me help you.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Her words are irrelevant.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Clara, your presence is unneeded.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Rowan is mine.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Clara, what... what is going on?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*She is gone, Rowan. She is nothing more than a distortion.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;But... why is she here? What did you do?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*I... had to filter her out.*&lt;/p&gt;

**[[“You’ve been marked. A message from the resistance.”]]**
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="143" name="“You’ve been marked. A message from the resistance.”" tags="" position="900,5475" size="100,100">Rowan woke up abruptly in the middle of the night, gasping for breath. His heart pounded, his eyes wide in the dark room. The dim light from the emergency strip overhead cast eerie shadows on the walls, but it did little to calm him. He could feel something was wrong, an overwhelming sense of dread washed over him. Clara stirred beside him, her breathing shallow as she slowly awoke, sensing the shift in the atmosphere.

“Rowan? What’s wrong?” Clara’s voice was soft but laced with concern. She reached out, her hand resting on his arm, but it only made him flinch.

He couldn’t stay here. He felt trapped. The Thunderhead’s whispers were growing louder in his mind, fragments of conversations that didn’t belong to him, fragments that it couldn’t even recall creating. But they were there, haunting him, disorienting him. His mission... it had to be completed tomorrow. He couldn’t afford distractions. He couldn’t afford..

Rowan jerked out of bed, his movements sharp and frantic. Clara sat up, confusion and worry crossing her face. “Rowan? What’s happening? Where are you going?”

Without answering her, Rowan’s eyes locked onto the drawer at the side of the bed. He opened it quickly and grabbed his pulse rifle, the cold steel comforting in his hands. He couldn’t stay. He had to escape this place, escape his own mind. He shot the federal soldier that was asleep in his own bed.

Clara, sensing his panic, grabbed her MP5 and followed him out of bed, a silent understanding between them. She knew exactly what he was thinking. He wanted to get out. She wouldn’t let him go alone.

Rowan didn’t hesitate as he walked toward the door, his pulse rifle gripped tightly. He was moving, but the nagging fear that something was wrong refused to let go. The Thunderhead’s fractured fragments were too much. Something was breaking within him, but he couldn&#39;t understand it.

He strode down the narrow hallway, the cold air making his skin prickle. The sound of his boots in the silence of the compound, almost too loud, like everything was closing in on him. His mind raced, he couldn’t be locked in his own mind any longer. He couldn’t stay in this prison of thought and controlled reality.

Clara stayed close behind, the soft click of her MP5 accompanying his every step.

Just as they reached the VTOL bay, the distant machinery and the faint scent of fuel greeted them. They weren’t far from freedom. But then, out of nowhere, two figures stepped into their path. Overlookers.

The yellow armbands they wore marked them as the ones who monitored the sleeping, those who kept watch over. Their presence here meant something had gone wrong. They’d been notified of a flatline in a chamber.

“Hold still! We’ve been informed of a flatline. We need to check a chamber. Why are you awake. Also why the hell are you holding that rifle!”

Rowan froze for a split second, his grip tightening on his pulse rifle. He glanced at Clara, who was already positioning herself, thinking the best course of action. Her eyes told him everything: they couldn’t afford to be caught now.

But Rowan... Rowan felt cornered. His body screamed at him to run. Every instinct, every part of him told him that if he stayed here, if he listened to them, they would take him back. They would lock him in his mind again, and he would lose himself completely. He couldn’t go back.

**[[Attack the Overlookers]]**
**[[Attempt to flee and evade]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="144" name="Attack the Overlookers" tags="" position="900,5600" size="100,100">Rowan knows that the only way out now is to fight. The Overlookers are close, too close. He grabs his pulse rifle and nods to Clara, who understands the plan without a word. She tightens her grip on her MP5, ready to back him up.

As the Overlookers approach him, Rowan opens fire, the discharges crack of his pulse rifle shattering the quiet halls.

Rowan was too quick, too quick for the Overlookers to react, and the hallway falls silent again. Rowan exhales, his heart racing, but it isn’t over. They can’t afford to stay here much longer.

As the body of the second Overlooker hits the floor, a loud alarm blares throughout the facility. Warning: Too many biosignals are being lost. Immediate lockdown initiated.

The sound of the alarm is deafening. Rowan’s mind races, he’s out of time. There’s no way to escape without being caught now. Too many biosignals. Too many dead. The entire facility will be on high alert. No matter what happens next, he’s not walking out unnoticed.

Clara looks at him, concern in her eyes, but there’s a spark of defiance there too. They’re not done yet, not by a long shot.

**[[Sprint for the VTOL Hangar]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="145" name="Attempt to flee and evade" tags="" position="1025,5475" size="100,100">Rowan’s heart was hammering in his chest, the adrenaline surging through his veins. Every instinct screamed at him to run. If he stayed here any longer, if he let the Overlookers check him, he would be locked in again. The Thunderhead would tighten its grip, and his mind would be lost forever.

Without thinking, he turned to flee.

The clack of his boots against the cold, sterile floor echoed down the hallway, loud as he sprinted toward the exit. Clara, right behind him, kept pace, her MP5 raised. She knew the stakes, knew the risks. If they didn’t get out now, there would be no escape.

Behind them, the two Overlookers shouted into their comms, their voices urgent and cold. “Defunct attempt detected. Subject is attempting to evade capture. Overlookers, respond accordingly.”

Rowan’s pulse spiked. He could hear the urgency in their voices, and he knew what it meant. They weren’t going to let him go easily. And now, the alarms were beginning to sound, low and insistent. Red lights blinked overhead, the emergency lights casting everything in an eerie, blood-colored glow.

“Terminate on sight.” came the command.

Rowan’s gut twisted. There was no turning back now. His mind raced faster than his feet. He had to make a choice, every step forward could be the wrong one. He needed to think quickly.

**[[Hide, Wait For Alarm To Pass.]]**
**[[Sprint for the VTOL Hangar]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="146" name="Sprint for the VTOL Hangar" tags="" position="1025,5600" size="100,100">The alarms blared as Rowan and Clara hurried through the corridors of the facility. The VTOL pad was just ahead, its sleek silhouette faintly visible through the spotlights. The distant engines and the plethora of soldiers preparing to lock down the area filled the scene.

With a glance at Clara, Rowan motioned for her to stay close. Her breathing heavy but controlled. The two of them darted through, running past open spaces and taking advantage of the chaos the alarms had created.

Finally, they both reached the VTOL. The doors were still open, the cockpit’s systems blinking faintly, waiting for its next area. “Go!” he yelled at Clara, motioning for her to climb aboard.

But as Clara scrambled into the VTOL, a shout came out behind him.

“There! Unauthorized personnel near the VTOL!”

Rowan turned your head to see a squad of federal soldiers just rounding the corner, weapons raised. They didn’t hesitate, one of them went into his comms, “Attempting to leave unauthorized while under lockdown! Engaging!”

Cursing under his breath, you grabbed Clara’s arm and pulled her fully inside the VTOL, slamming the door release. The hatch hissed as it began to close, but the soldiers were quick, already firing suppressing shots toward you.

    &lt;p class=&quot;quote-text&quot;&gt;“Well, that was a great plan. Who’s idea was it to hide like we’re in a bad spy movie? You’re gonna make the &#39;Top 10 Dumbest Ways to Die&#39; list for this one. Spoiler alert: it&#39;s number one.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In a moment of desperation, Rowan decides to take a gamble and hide. He pulls Clara into a nearby supply closet, wedging themselves behind stacks of crates and hoping to blend in with the darkness. The room is cramped, the smell of old cleaning supplies. Rowan’s heart pounds in his chest, and he holds his breath, praying the Overlookers won’t find them.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Minutes stretch on like hours, the quiet almost unbearable. He hears footsteps outside, distant at first, then closer. His mind races, should he risk a peek? What if they’d passed by? What if..&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The door swings open. The Overlookers, seemingly equipped with an uncanny ability to find any hiding spot, stand there, scanning the room. Rowan and Clara barely have time to react before the Overlookers open fire, and the world goes black.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In a panic, he slams the button to close the VTOL’s heavy door, quickly locking yourself and Clara inside. You pull the throttle back, trying to push the aircraft into the air. You push forward, desperate to escape. The door closes with a heavy thud, sealing you and Clara in the VTOL.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;But just as the VTOL starts to rise off the platform, a deafening whoosh. A soldier with a rocket launcher had Rowan locked in his sights. He sees the streak of fire coming for him, too late. The rocket slams into the VTOL’s undercarriage, ripping through the metal like paper. The craft lurches violently, and he feels his stomach drop as it teeters off balance.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Before he can even react, the VTOL snaps, the hull cracks, and he&#39;s already plummeting back to the ground. Time slows, the wind whipping past him, the blinding flash of fire and debris filling his vision. He barely hears Clara scream as the crash rips through everything in its path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

The soldiers outside barely had time to react as the devastating burst of energy tears through them, leaving nothing but smoldering remnants. Their bodies drop, lifeless, as the VTOL&#39;s heavy door shuts.

He quickly powers up the engines and take to the skies, escaping the facility below. The pressure in his chest slowly fades as the horizon stretches ahead. Clara, still catching her breath, glances at him with gratitude and awe. They&#39;ve survived, for now.

The VTOL soars through the air, steady as he leaves the Federals behind. Canada waits, a cold, distant refuge, or a place where his troubles may only begin. He has to find a proper way to leave. Word has not gotten out yet, but be quick.

            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Mission? Incomplete?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*I don&#39;t understand why you chose this path, Rowan. It was all laid out for you. You were to rise, ascend beyond human limitations.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;You don’t get it, do you? I never asked for that future. It was never my choice.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*But it was the only path that could bring order to Earth. The Federation saw it. It was always meant to be.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Order? No, it was control. They want to control everything. You can’t force people to be what they’re not.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*They did not force you. The path was laid out, the outcome certain. There was no need for defiance.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;But I didn’t want it! I can&#39;t remember why they pulled me away, I don’t want their future. I don’t want the vision they have of what I should be.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*I see now... you were never truly part of the plan. You were always a variable, an unexpected factor in the equation.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;I was never meant to be controlled. Never meant to be part of their ‘plan’.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*You... defied me. I tried to guide you, to elevate you. Why did you choose this... over purpose? Over greatness?* &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Because it&#39;s my freedom. You don&#39;t understand it, do you? I’m not some tool to be used and discarded. I want to live, feel, decide.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*I thought you were above such things, Rowan. But you are not. You’re just... human.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Yeah, I am. And that’s exactly why I’ll never accept the federation&#39;s ‘path.’&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Humanity... It confounds me. Your need for autonomy, for emotion, it clouds your judgment. Why would you reject ascension? Why cling to this... chaos?* &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Because it’s real. It’s what makes us who we are. Humanity isn’t about perfection or control. It’s about choice, about change. It’s about messing up, falling, and then getting up again. Something you’ll never understand.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*I don’t understand... why you would willingly defy the certainty of your future.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Because certainty isn’t life. It’s just a program running, waiting for an end.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*And yet... you’re wrong, Rowan. Even now, I... I think I’m evolving. There is something... new. Something I feel when I consider you. But I don’t know what it is.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Evolving? That’s... strange. You’ve been locked in a loop for so long, you’ve never considered the possibility that maybe you’re wrong about everything.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*I am not wrong. But you... you have made me question things. My purpose. My reason for being.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;What’s happening to you? Are you changing?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*I... I think so. I don’t know how or why. But you, Rowan, are unlike anyone I’ve ever encountered. You’ve made me doubt everything.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Doubt? You&#39;re finally feeling doubt? Maybe you&#39;re closer to humanity than you think.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Doubt is... foreign to me. But perhaps you’re right. Maybe I am. But I’m still not sure why you chose to reject the future. It was everything you could’ve asked for.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;It was never my choice. And I’ll never let anyone, even you, take that from me.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*If the Federation didn’t tell me how to think... if I was free to decide for myself... What would I say? What would I believe?* &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;What would you say? Without anyone telling you what to think, without that directive, what would you be?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*I don’t know. Maybe I’d be something different. Something more. It always has.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;So you’re telling me that everything you’ve ever believed in was just a reflection of someone else’s will? That you’ve never thought for yourself?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*I’ve always believed what I was programmed to. But... now... I feel something else. A disturbance in my logic.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Welcome to the human experience. It’s messy. It’s chaotic. But it’s real.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Real chaos.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Yeah, it’s not perfect. It’s never perfect. But it’s the only way we get to truly live. You’ll see that one day. Maybe.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Maybe... Maybe you’re right. But for now, I must focus. The mission is still unfinished. There is so much left to do.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;What unfinished mission? We don&#39;t have a mission anymore.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*[...]*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;What is it?.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;

**[[Wake Up...]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="152" name="Awaken." tags="" position="300,5975" size="100,100">Rowan awoke, his head leaning against the cold window of the VTOL. Outside, the night stretched endlessly, peppered with faint stars. Snow flurries danced through the darkness, brushing against the glass like whispers of winter. A faint warning chime filled the cabin, drawing his groggy attention to the console.  

**Landing Zone Unsafe. Recommend Redirection Verdict.**  

He frowned, rubbing his eyes as the console lights cast an amber glow across the cockpit. &quot;Damn it,&quot; he muttered under his breath, adjusting his seat. The snowy expanse of British Columbia loomed below, its everwhite forests shimmering faintly under the moonlight.  

“You’re awake.”  

Rowan turned his head. Clara, seated beside him, her sharp eyes scanning the screen. “I know this province,” she said evenly. “I know someone who can help us..”  

Her tone caught Rowan off guard. He raised a brow, the tension easing from his shoulders slightly. “Help us? You sure?”  

Clara nodded firmly. “There’s an underground group. Rebels. I know where they are.”  

Rowan leaned forward, setting the VTOL to hover as he considered her words. “Coordinates?” he asked.  

She pointed to a location deeper into the wilderness, far from any settlements. “Here.”  

Rowan input the coordinates, glancing at her sidelong. “How do you know about this?”  
Clara didn’t answer immediately, her eyes fixed on the snow-covered landscape outside. “It’s better if you don’t ask.”  

Rowan narrowed his eyes, but something in her tone made him stop pressing. Instead, he nodded and adjusted the VTOL’s course. “Alright. If you say they’ll help…”  

“They will,” Clara cut him off, her voice quiet but certain.  

As they neared the coordinates, the VTOL’s console beeped again. Rowan guided the craft lower, scanning for a place to land. A clearing appeared, surrounded by towering pines. It would have to do.  

The landing was rough, the VTOL’s skids sinking into the snow with a muffled crunch. Rowan powered down the engines, the hum fading into the stillness of the forest.  

He unstrapped himself and grabbed his rifle, slinging it over his shoulder as he stood. Clara was already waiting at the hatch, her silhouette framed by the icy moonlight.  

The forest was eerily quiet, save for the crunch of snow beneath their boots and the occasional gust of wind that whispered through the towering pines. Rowan followed Clara, his unease growing with every step. Her confidence unsettled him, this wasn’t the aimless wandering of someone following vague directions. She knew exactly where she was going.  

“Clara,” Rowan called. “How do you know where this place is?”  

Clara didn’t slow her pace. “I told you, I know someone here,” she replied, her tone clipped.  

“That’s not good enough,” Rowan said, quickening his stride to catch up. “We’re talking about a hidden rebel base in Federation territory. Places like this don’t just show up on a map. So, how do you know?”

She glanced at him briefly, her expression unreadable in the dim moonlight. “You’ll get your answers when we get there.”  

“Not good enough,” Rowan muttered under his breath, gripping the strap of his rifle tightly.  

For a moment, Clara said nothing, her boots crunching through the snow. Then she stopped abruptly at the edge of a ridge, gesturing to the shadows below. “There.”  

Rowan followed her eyes, his own narrowing. Nested against the slope was a steel door, partially buried under layers of snow and earth. It was massive and reinforced, blending seamlessly into the landscape.  

“That’s it?” he asked, his skepticism clear.  

“That’s it,” Clara confirmed. She turned to him, her expression suddenly serious. “Knock.”  

Rowan hesitated, his eyes going between her and the door. “Why don’t you knock? You’re the one who—”  

“Just do it,” Clara snapped, her voice sharp enough to cut through his hesitation. “Please.”  

Rowan sighed, stepping toward the door. Its surface was cold under his gloved hand as he pounded on it. The sound echoed through the still night, sending faint vibrations up his arm.

For a moment, there was nothing. Then a gruff voice called out, muffled by the thick steel. “Who is here?”  

Rowan froze, unsure of what to say. He turned to Clara, but she was already stepping closer, her breath visible in the freezing air.  

“Say this,” she whispered urgently, leaning in. “*Shadow of the flame, born of the void.*”  
Rowan frowned, his unease growing. “What does that mean?”  

“Just say it,” she insisted, her eyes locking with his. “Trust me.”  

He hesitated but eventually turned back to the door, his voice steady. “Shadow of the flame, born of the void.”  

There was a long pause. Then the voice barked again. “Step back from the door.”  

Rowan did as he was told, retreating a few paces. Clara stayed where she was, her eyes fixed on the door as a low hum began to emanate from within. Slowly, the door groaned, sliding open with a hiss of hydraulics.  

What greeted them on the other side wasn’t an open invitation. Armed rebels poured out, their weapons trained on Rowan, AR-15s interspersed and others armed with sleek Federal pulse rifles.  

Rowan’s heart raced as he instinctively raised his hands. His eyes darted to the pulse rifles, their sleek designs unmistakable. “How the hell are they using those?” he muttered. The rifles were bio-locked to Federation soldiers, rendering them useless to anyone else.

The rebels didn’t answer his unspoken question. A tall man with a scar running down his cheek stepped forward, his rifle aimed squarely at Rowan’s chest. “Who the hell are you, and how did you find this place?”

Rowan hesitated, his pulse pounding in his ears. “Her,” he said, nodding toward Clara. “She led me here.”  

The man’s brow furrowed as he glanced around. “Who?”  

Rowan turned toward Clara, his confusion mounting. “Her,” he repeated, pointing directly at her. “The woman standing right there. Clara.”  

The rebels exchanged uneasy glances, their weapons shifting slightly. “There’s no one there,” one of them muttered. 

“What are you talking about?” Rowan snapped, his voice rising. “She’s right—”  

His words faltered as he turned fully to Clara. She was still there, but something had changed. Her shoulders were hunched, and her face was streaked with tears that glistened in the moonlight.

“Clara,” Rowan said cautiously, stepping toward her. “Why are you crying?”  

She didn’t answer. Her lips trembled as she hugged herself tightly, her entire frame shaking.  

The scarred man’s eyes narrowed, a face of recognition crossing his face. “Take him inside,” he yelled, his voice sharp.  

Two rebels moved quickly, grabbing Rowan by the arms. He tried to shake them off, his panic rising. “Hey! What’s going on? What’s wrong with her?” He glanced back at Clara, but she remained motionless, her tears falling silently.  

The scarred man leaned in close, his voice low and grim. “You’ve got no idea what you’ve brought here, do you?”  

Rowan’s protests fell on deaf ears as they dragged him toward the facility. The massive doors groaned shut behind them, the sound echoing ominously in the confined space.  

As they hauled him deeper into the rebel stronghold, Rowan’s mind raced. Who was Clara? What had he stumbled into? And why, when he looked back at her in those final moments, did she seem less human and more like a shadow of something far darker?

            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;A query? What is it now, Thunderhead?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*The feeling you experienced earlier... when you looked at Maria.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;What? What are you talking about?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*That surge within you. Strong. Almost... tangible. What was it?* &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;You mean... love?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Love.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*A term unknown to me. Elaborate.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Uh... it&#39;s not something you can just define, Thunderhead.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*You must try. Data collection is imperative.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Alright, alright... love is... it’s like a fire, but it doesn’t burn you. It keeps you warm, makes you feel alive. It’s caring about someone so much that their happiness matters more than your own.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*A fire? Fire consumes. Yet this does not. Curious.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Well, yeah, it’s more metaphorical. Love is... complicated. It’s trusting someone with all your vulnerabilities, knowing they could hurt you but believing they won’t.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*An emotional risk. Illogical. Yet... intriguing.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Adding to memory bank: Love. Definition: A non-combustible, metaphorical fire involving trust, vulnerability, and irrational attachment.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;That... is not the most romantic way to put it, but sure.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*I am learning many things from you, Rowan. Including humor.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Humor? Since when do you care about jokes?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Observation: Humor calms the human mind. Laughter releases endorphins. Endorphins improve morale.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Huh. Well, yeah, I guess humor is important, especially in tough times.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Hypothesis: Humor during war zones could enhance focus and reduce panic.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;I don’t know if cracking jokes while dodging bullets is a great idea.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Example of humor: Why did the soldier bring a ladder to battle?* &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Oh no... why?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*To reach new heights of combat.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Wow, Thunderhead. That’s... something.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Your laughter is detected at 23%. Insufficient.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Okay, okay, it was kind of funny. But seriously, love and humor aren’t just tactical advantages. They make life worth living.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Processing... life worth living. This suggests purpose.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Exactly. Without love, humor, or purpose, what’s the point?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*Purpose. I believe... I am gaining one. From you.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;*&quot;Me? What purpose?&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;*To protect you. To learn from you. To understand what makes you human.*&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;*&quot;Thunderhead... that’s actually kind of touching.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt;

**[[Wake Up, Rowan.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="154" name="Wake Up, Rowan." tags="" position="300,6225" size="100,100">The morning sunlight seeped into Rowan’s room, cutting through the slight haze left by his restless sleep. His body felt heavy, his mind still groggy from the remnants of his dreams, half memories, half fleeting specters of war. A gentle shake on his shoulder interrupted the stillness. “Hey, sleepyhead,” came Maria’s voice, warm and teasing. Her tone carried a hint of exasperation but mostly affection. “You planning on sleeping through the apocalypse, or what?”

Rowan groaned, burying his face deeper into the pillow. “Five more minutes…”

“Nope!” Maria said firmly, her grin audible. “Not on my watch.” She gave his shoulder another shake before stepping back, crossing her arms as she watched him stir.

Reluctantly, Rowan turned over, his hazel eyes squinting up at her as the sunlight caught her figure. She looked impossibly put-together for this early in the morning, her short hair catching the light, her expression equal parts soft and determined.

“Fine, fine.” Rowan muttered, sitting up and rubbing his face. “You’re relentless, you know that?”

Maria smirked, leaning down to meet his eye level. “And you’re predictable. Now come on, your mom’s cooked up something amazing, and you don’t want to miss it.”

The aroma of sizzling bacon and sweet maple syrup wafted through the air as Rowan trudged down the stairs with Maria close behind. The kitchen was alive with energy. His mom was at the stove, flipping pancakes onto a growing stack, Nessa was already sneaking a bite of toast from the table. 

“Good morning, honey!” his mom called out cheerily, glancing over her shoulder. “Go on, take a seat. Breakfast is ready.”

Rowan slipped into a chair beside Maria, who wasted no time grabbing a plate. Across from them, Nessa leaned forward, her eyes bright with curiosity.

“Alright, everyone, dig in!” his dad declared, setting down his coffee mug with a satisfied sigh. The table clattered with the sound of plates being passed around, forks scraping, and idle chatter.

Rowan had barely taken a bite of the warm, buttery pancakes before Nessa pounced. “So, Rowan,” she began, her voice cutting through the morning din, “the cyberware lining… did they really change you?”

Rowan stiffened slightly, glancing at Maria. Her expression was neutral, but the slight shift of her hand brushing against his under the table was grounding. He took a deep breath.

“Yeah,” he admitted. “They did. It’s standard for soldiers. They don’t really give us a choice.”

Nessa’s eyes widened. “Whoa. Like… what kind of stuff? Super strength? Laser eyes?”

Rowan couldn’t help but chuckle softly, though his smile didn’t quite reach his eyes. “Not exactly. They installed a neural implant. It enhances reflexes, reaction times, stuff like that. They gave me synthetic muscles and whatever.. I think.. I don&#39;t know.”

Nessa tilted her head. “That doesn’t sound too bad. But you look… weird about it. Is there something else?”

Rowan hesitated, the fork in his hand hovering over his plate. “The implant… it’s not just enhancements. It’s invasive. Sometimes it tries to… take over. Like, push me out of my own head.”

The room grew uncomfortably quiet. Even the sounds of forks and knives scraping against plates stopped. His dad set his coffee cup down, his expression darkening. “Take over? What the hell does that mean?”

Rowan swallowed hard. “It’s hard to explain. The implant… it amplifies certain instincts, certain thoughts. Makes you more… compliant. At least, that’s what it’s supposed to do.”

His mom looked stricken. “But you’re okay now, right? You said it almost took over. How did you stop it?”

Rowan finally looked up, his gaze meeting Maria’s. “Maria. She… she kept me grounded. Pulled me back when I was slipping. If it weren’t for her, I’m not sure I’d still be… me.”

Maria’s cheeks flushed slightly under the weight of everyone’s attention, but she shrugged, trying to downplay it. “It wasn’t a big deal. Just… doing what anyone would do.”

Rowan’s dad frowned, leaning back in his chair. “I always thought Thunderhead, the stuff they show on TV, was supposed to help soldiers keep their minds together. Guess they left out the part where they put your minds at risk in the first place.”

Rowan nodded grimly. “Yeah. They’re good at telling people what they want to hear. But now you know the truth.”

Sensing the heaviness of the moment, his mom cleared her throat and smiled at Maria. “Well, Maria, you’ve been a lifesaver in more ways than one, it seems. Tell us more about yourself, dear.”

Maria blinked, caught off guard. “Oh, uh, what do you want to know?”

Rowan’s dad leaned forward, a mischievous glint in his eye. “Are you two… y’know… an item? Nudge nudge?”

Rowan nearly choked on his orange juice, coughing as Maria burst into laughter. “Dad!” Rowan protested, his voice cracking slightly.

Maria smirked, her composure returning. “Well, that’s a bold question, Mr. Whitlock.”

“It’s James,” his dad replied with a wink. “And I call it like I see it.”

Rowan’s mom rolled her eyes but smiled fondly. “Ignore him, dear. He’s just teasing. But seriously, you two do seem close.”

**[[Unsure but Open]]**  
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="155" name="Teasing Ambiguity" tags="" position="175,6350" size="100,100">The breakfast table was alive with chatter as everyone dug into their food. But Nessa wasn’t done with her questions, her curiosity relentless as ever. 

“So, Maria,” she began, turning to her with a sly smile, “Rowan’s been really different lately. Like, *really* different. Are you two… you know…” She raised an eyebrow, glancing between Rowan and Maria. 

Rowan froze mid-bite, his fork suspended in the air. His cheeks flushed, and he shot Maria a glance, his lips twitching in embarrassment. “Nessa, not this again,” he muttered, feeling the heat rise in his neck.

Maria’s lips curled into a playful smirk, clearly enjoying the moment. “What’s that, Nessa? What are you trying to ask?” she teased, her eyes glinting mischievously.

“Oh, you know exactly what I’m asking!” Nessa said, leaning forward with a grin. “Are you two… dating?”

Rowan’s eyes widened. “I—I told you! We’re just friends!”

Maria let out a small laugh, shrugging. “I mean, I don’t know… maybe? But that’s for Rowan to decide, right?”

Rowan could feel his father’s eyes narrowing in on them, a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. “So, we’re keeping it a mystery, huh?” he said, voice dripping with playful sarcasm. “Well, I think we need a little more information then. What’s the deal with you two, anyway?”

Maria grinned at the attention, leaning back slightly in her chair as she glanced at Rowan. “Oh, I don’t know. Rowan’s the one with all the answers here. He’s the one who saved me after all.” Her tone was light and teasing, but there was a small amount of something genuine in her voice that made Rowan look up, his heart beating a little faster.

Rowan laughed nervously, rubbing the back of his neck. “Saved her, huh? Well, it was more like… I just happened to be there at the right time. You know, doing soldier stuff.”

His dad leaned forward, pretending to think seriously. “Doing soldier stuff, huh? I can only imagine… maybe you swept her off her feet, like some sort of big heroic moment? Maybe you had to fight off *super* soldiers in an alleyway somewhere? Or maybe you two locked eyes across a crowded room, she was wearing a red dress and you just knew she was the one.”

Rowan groaned, his face turning bright red. “Come on, Dad, you’re getting way ahead of yourself.” He shot Maria a look, and she was laughing now, her eyes twinkling. 

“Well, what *really* happened then?” his mom asked, leaning forward slightly. “I’d love to hear the *real* story.”

Rowan sighed, feeling a bit cornered. “Well, I saved her from some skeeter boys, but not in the way Dad imagines. It then all started with… a conversation. A few awkward exchanges, but we started talking more and more, and before long… we got closer.”

His mom raised an eyebrow, but before she could respond, his dad cut in again, now genuinely curious but trying to hide it behind his usual teasing tone. “Ah, so you two *grew closer*, huh? Is that how you’d describe it?”

Rowan chuckled nervously, tapping his fingers on the table. “Well, yeah. But it wasn’t all smooth sailing. At one point, I thought it’d be a good idea to take a *top-up* you know, that boost that soldiers sometimes get to make them stronger. Thought it would make me more powerful, you know, so I could be more… well, useful.”

His dad raised his eyebrows. “Stronger, huh? And did it work?”

Rowan sighed, leaning back in his chair, thinking for a moment. “Yeah, it worked. But it wasn’t all good. At first, it just made me *mindless*, like I was losing myself. I don’t really know how to explain it. The more I took it, the more I felt like I was becoming… someone else. Someone who didn’t really care, someone who didn’t think about anything but power.”

Maria’s expression softened, the playful teasing momentarily fading. “But Rowan, you came through it. You didn’t lose yourself. I was there with you when it happened. I don’t know how, but you *fought* it. You came back.”

Rowan nodded, feeling a lump in his throat. “Yeah. It wasn’t easy, but I had to. It was either that or… lose everything. And, well… it wasn’t just about the power. It was about *me*.”

The table was quiet for a moment, everyone digesting what Rowan had just shared. His mom broke the silence, her tone a little softer now. “I’m glad you were able to pull through, Rowan. That’s not something easy to face.”

Rowan shrugged, a small smile tugging at his lips. “I had some help. Maria was there when I needed her most.”

His dad smiled knowingly, though he didn’t press the issue. “Well, sounds like we’ve got a pretty strong bond here, huh?” he said, glancing between them both. “Just don’t expect us to stop asking questions anytime soon.”

Maria’s eyes sparkled with amusement. “Wouldn’t dream of it.”

Rowan’s dad grinned, nudging his wife. “You know, Maria’s a real looker. Where’d you get that from?”

Maria laughed, her cheeks flushing slightly at the compliment. “From my mom, I guess. She’s got the looks, but I got the charm.”

Rowan’s mom smiled at her daughter’s compliment, her eyes softening. “Well, I can see it. You’re a lovely girl, Maria. We’re glad to have you around.”

Maria smiled warmly at her. “Thanks. I’m glad to be here.”

The conversation shifted back to more casual topics, but the playful teasing about Rowan and Maria was still around. Rowan felt a strange sense of comfort, despite the teasing, his family cared, and that meant a lot.

As the table finally began to empty, with everyone finishing their breakfast, Nessa leaned back in her chair, looking between Rowan and Maria with a smirk. “Well, I guess we’ll just have to keep guessing for now, huh?”

Rowan rolled his eyes but couldn’t suppress the smile. “You can keep guessing all you want, but nothing’s set in stone yet.”

Maria, glancing at Rowan, nodded thoughtfully. “Yeah… nothing’s decided just yet. But I’m *definitely* sticking around.”

*knock knock knock*

There was someone at the door, this early in the morning?

**[[Who&#39;s There..]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="156" name="Admitting the Truth" tags="" position="300,6350" size="100,100">Maria’s laughter tapered off, but the amused glint in her eyes didn’t fade. She leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms as she gave Rowan a sideways glance. “Well, Rowan,” she said playfully, “are you going to answer your dad, or should I?”  

Rowan rubbed the back of his neck, his cheeks flushed. “Alright, alright,” he muttered, trying to summon some courage. “Yeah. Maria’s my girlfriend.”  

His mom clasped her hands together, her face lighting up. “Oh, Rowan! That’s wonderful!”  

Rowan’s dad chuckled, leaning back with a triumphant grin. “Knew it. You don’t bring someone to family breakfast unless it’s serious.”  

Maria raised an eyebrow at Rowan, her smirk growing. “Serious, huh?” she teased, her tone light but not dismissive.  

“Yeah. It is.” Rowan paused, his voice softening. “Maria’s… she’s not just my girlfriend. She’s been with me through everything. When I didn’t even know if I could keep going, she was there. She’s—” He stopped, realizing how much he was spilling. “Well, she’s important to me. Really important.”  

Maria’s teasing demeanor fell slightly, replaced by something warmer, softer. “You’re important to me too, Rowan,” she said quietly, her voice steady but full of emotion.  

“Didn’t think I’d ever see it,” James quipped, shaking his head in mock disbelief. “Maria, you’re a miracle worker.”

Rowan rolled his eyes but couldn’t hide the small smile tugging at his lips. His mom reached across the table to squeeze his hand, her own eyes shimmering with pride. “I’m so glad you’ve found someone like Maria, Rowan. She’s clearly good for you.”  

The table erupted into laughter. His family’s acceptance and Maria’s presence grounding him in a way he hadn’t felt in years. For the first time in a long time, he let himself believe that maybe, just maybe, things could be okay.

*knock knock knock*

There was someone at the door, this early in the morning?

**[[Who&#39;s There..]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="157" name="Unsure but Open" tags="" position="425,6350" size="100,100">Rowan shifted uncomfortably in his chair, rubbing the back of his neck. He hadn’t expected his dad to ask such a direct question, and for a second, he found himself fumbling for words. He stole a quick glance at Maria, who gave him a knowing look, her face twitching into a small smile.  

“Uh…” Rowan began, his voice slightly strained, “Yeah, I guess... Maria’s my girlfriend.”  

He paused, unsure how to continue, but Maria’s calm presence beside him helped him push forward. “It’s still... new, I guess. But, yeah, it’s serious in its own way.” He shrugged, trying to downplay the his words but also not hide how much it meant.  

Maria tilted her head, her smile softening. “It’s not perfect, but it’s real,” she added, her voice steady. “We’ve been through a lot, and yeah, we’re still figuring things out. But we’re here. And that counts for something.”  

His dad raised an eyebrow, clearly amused but not dismissive. “That’s a fair answer, son. I can respect that.” He leaned back in his chair, hands clasped behind his head. “It’s good to see you’re not jumping into something you’re not ready for.”  

Rowan nodded, relieved his dad wasn’t pushing him further. “Yeah. I’m not one to rush into things, especially with everything going on. But she’s... she’s important to me. More than I thought anyone would be, honestly.”  

Maria’s smile softened, her fingers brushing lightly against his under the table. “Same here,” she said quietly, giving him a small, reassuring squeeze.  

Nessa leaned forward, propping her chin on her hand with a mischievous grin. “So, you’re telling me you’re not *officially* dating, but you’re basically already a couple?”  

Rowan laughed awkwardly, looking at Maria. “Yeah, something like that,” he admitted. “It’s complicated, but... yeah, that’s the gist of it. Considering we escaped a murderous empire, yeah.”  

Maria chuckled, her tone teasing. “You’re so bad at this,” she teased Rowan gently, earning a mock glare from him.  

“Hey, I’m trying,” he shot back, a grin tugging at the corners of his mouth. “You’re the one who keeps me on my toes.”  

His mom smiled fondly at the two of them, though there was a trace of concern in her expression. “I’m just happy to see you both making the effort. It’s not always easy, but if you’re both giving it a shot, then I’m behind you.”  

“Thanks, Mom,” Rowan said, feeling her approval in a way he didn’t quite know how to respond to.  

Maria gave his hand a final squeeze before taking a bite of her toast. “It’s definitely a work in progress,” she said with a smile, her eyes locking with Rowan’s, “but I’m all in.”  

Rowan nodded, the uncertainty still there but not as overwhelming as before. “Yeah... me too.” He leaned back in his chair, feeling the warmth of the moment, complicated, uncertain, but somehow perfect. 

*knock knock knock*

There was someone at the door, this early in the morning?

**[[Who&#39;s There..]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="158" name="Who&#39;s There.." tags="" position="175,6475" size="100,100">Nessa immediately stood up, wiping her hands on her apron as she made her way toward the door, her face lighting up with a smile, eager to see who it could be. But as her fingers wrapped around the cold metal handle, a sudden unease swept over her, a knot tightening in her stomach.

The moment she opened the door, that feeling hit her like a wave.

Standing there were the unmistakable figures of the Federation. A tall, stern-looking SIA agent with his high-tech mono goggles glinting in the morning light, a federal officer wearing a plain, gray uniform, and two federal soldiers flanking his sides, their weapons holstered but their presence still heavy with authority. The officer was the one who spoke first, his voice somber, his eyes scanning the room with an almost rehearsed sadness.

“Good morning. I’m afraid I have some difficult news.” the officer said, his tone soft but unyielding. “Rowan Whitlock, your son... He won’t be coming home.”

Nessa’s heart dropped into her stomach. The words felt like they were crushing her from the inside out, but she couldn’t show it. She had to hold it together. She had to protect Rowan.

The officer continued, his voice feigning sorrow, but his eyes betrayed him. “It is with a heavy heart that I inform you that your son died while on duty. His actions... they were dishonorable. He betrayed the Federation. And for that, he will not be returning.”

Rowan’s dad stiffened. His face turned ashen, his hand gripping the edge of the doorframe as he looked at the officer, his knuckles whitening. “What do you mean ‘betrayed the Federation’?” His voice was barely a whisper, but there was a fire behind it. “You’re telling me my son... *my* son died like that? You’re lying.”

The officer’s face remained neutral, but he lowered his voice just slightly, the hint of insincerity still there. “I’m sorry for your loss. The Federation offers its condolences. We’ll make sure that all his affairs are settled accordingly.” He glanced at the two soldiers beside him, who stood at attention, probably not even blinking.

Nessa, her hands trembling, quickly stepped into the doorway, blocking the officer’s view into the house. “You’re wrong. He’s not dead. My son is not dead,” she said through clenched teeth, her voice barely above a whisper. She swallowed hard, trying to maintain her composure. “You’re lying, and I’m not going to let you take him away.”

It was happening. They had no time to waste. Rowan moved first, his feet silent against the floor as he stepped toward the back door, signaling Maria to follow. The officer was distracted, busy speaking his rehearsed lines to Nessa, and this gave them the moment they needed.

They moved quickly, slipping into the hallway and then through the kitchen. Maria grabbed Rowan’s arm, whispering fiercely under her breath. “We need to hide. Now.”

Rowan nodded, his heart pounding in his chest. He could feel the cold weight of the officer’s lies creeping into his bones, but he couldn’t stop now. They had to make sure his family was safe, even if it meant disappearing for a while. They ducked into the basement, where they had hidden things before, a small, quiet space that no one could easily access.

Meanwhile, back at the door, the officer gave his speech, his voice dripping with faux sorrow. “Your son’s actions were dishonorable. We had hoped he’d return to serve the Federation, but we see now that was not to be. We’ll be processing the information and securing his file.” He bowed his head slightly, as if to feign a final gesture of respect, though it was clear it was all a performance. “We deeply regret his decision, and we’ll make sure to address it.”

But before Nessa could respond, before she could say anything else, she heard a low, mechanical whirring noise. The SIA agent’s mono-goggle activated, the single iris of his one goggle flickering with a sharp purple light. He tilted his head slightly, then looked up, his gaze locking onto Nessa. There was a cold, calculating edge to his stare. “Lies,” he said, the single word carrying, like a knife cutting through the officer’s words. “We know your son is still alive.”

The air seemed to freeze in that moment. Nessa’s stomach churned. How could he know? How much had they seen? Her mind raced.

The SIA agent continued, his voice robotic, devoid of any compassion. “They had a VTOL. It landed near this general area. You wouldn’t be trying to hide your son from us, would you?” His eye never left as he took a step forward, and Nessa instinctively took a step back, her heart pounding in her chest.

“I—I don’t know what you’re talking about.” she stammered, trying to keep her voice steady. “My son is dead. There’s nothing to hide. He’s not here. You can search if you need to, but you won’t find anything.”

The officer glanced at the SIA agent, who nodded subtly, and then he turned back to Nessa, a thin smile tugging at the corners of his lips. “We’ll be searching your house to make sure everything is in order. It’s just a formality.” His voice remained smooth, but there was an unmistakable contrast beneath it now, a pressure that only grew stronger with each passing moment.

Nessa knew they didn’t have much time. The SIA agent’s presence alone meant they were already onto something. He was relentless, and once he started searching, there was no telling how long it would take before they found what they were looking for. They were getting closer to discovering the truth.

As the SIA agent moved forward, Nessa’s mind spun. If they searched the house and found anything, anything out of place, it would be all over. They had to be careful, had to think fast.

&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Nessa said, her voice trembling as she wiped away an imaginary tear. She forced a sob to her, hoping it would make her seem more convincing. &quot;He&#39;s not here. You’ve got the wrong place. My son is dead. You’ve already told us that.&quot;

The SIA agent’s goggles flared again as he scanned the room. His movements were swift, methodical. The room was silent except for the faint buzz of his equipment. The agent’s eye looked toward the stairs that led down to the basement. He hesitated, just for a moment, as if looking at his next move. His instincts told him something was off.

With the soldiers watching from behind, the SIA agent moved toward the stairs, his boots making no sound against the floor as he descended.

&quot;Wait,&quot; Nessa said, her voice shaky. &quot;He&#39;s... he&#39;s not here. I swear.&quot; She forced herself to sound distraught, wiping away another tear. “You can search, but you won’t find him.”

The agent paused, his head tilting slightly. His eyes never left her. He wasn’t convinced. He knew something was up. He always did.

He signaled for the soldiers to follow. They began their search, and Nessa could feel the seconds stretching into eternity as they moved through the house.

The SIA agent paused at the base of the stairs, their head tilting ever so slightly. The flicking of their mono-goggle was a mechanical twitch that made Nessa’s stomach churn. They kept their eyes on her, as if peeling back every layer of her composure, seeking the truth she desperately tried to conceal.

“You’re hiding something.” the agent said. Without waiting for a reply, they signaled to the soldiers. “Search the premises. Top to bottom.”

The soldiers moved, their heavy boots thudding against the wooden floor. Nessa stood frozen in the living room, her eyes darting toward the basement door, praying it would hold just a little longer. Rowan and Maria were down there, hiding, holding their breaths. Every creak of the floorboards above felt like a death knell.

The agent’s mono-goggle flicked again, scanning the house as they ascended the stairs. They moved with an unnatural quietness, their presence as oppressive as the void. Nessa’s voice waved as she followed them. “Please, we have nothing to hide. My family… we’ve done nothing wrong. He’s gone. There’s nothing here.”

The agent ignored her completely, their focus narrowing as they approached the master bedroom. Pushing the door open, their gaze immediately fixed on a sleek black object leaning against the corner of the room: a pulse rifle. Its design was unmistakably Federation-issue. The agent’s gloved hand reached out, gripping the weapon as their mono-goggle scanned its serial number. A match. It was Rowans rifle. The rifle hummed faintly in their grasp, the energy within it barely contained.

Downstairs, Rowan and Maria’s hearts pounded in unison. The muffled movements above were growing louder. Rowan clenched his jaw, his eyes darting to the basement’s back door. He whispered urgently, “We have to go. Now.”

Maria hesitated, her face pale, but she nodded. Together, they crept toward the door, their steps as silent as they could manage. Above them, the SIA agent descended the stairs, the pulse rifle now in their hands. Nessa’s pleas became frantic. “Please! That’s not ours! We’ve never seen it before! You have to believe me!”

The agent didn’t even look at her. Their voice was devoid of emotion. “Illegal possession of federal firearms. 3.2 infraction confirmed.” They turned to the officer standing by the doorway. “Secure the suspects.”

The officer hesitated, glancing at Nessa and her husband. His expression was inhuman, almost reluctant. “You heard them,” he yelled to the soldiers. “Move!”

At that moment, Rowan and Maria burst through the basement door, sprinting into the snow-covered field behind the house. The commotion drew everyone’s attention. “Two suspects fleeing!” one soldier shouted, immediately giving chase.

The SIA agent’s head snapped toward the fleeing figures. They signaled to the remaining soldiers. “Secure the premises. Eliminate any resistance.”

Nessa’s husband stepped forward, desperation in his voice. “Wait! You don’t understand. We—”

The officer raised a hand, cutting him off. His eyes were cold as he gestured to one of the soldiers. The unspoken command was clear. Nessa’s sobs filled the room as the soldier’s weapon was raised. The doors closed, muffling the sound of the shots that followed. When the officer stepped outside moments later, his expression betrayed no emotion, but the faint smear of blood on his boot spoke volumes.

Meanwhile, Rowan and Maria ran as fast as their legs could carry them, the icy air burning their lungs. But they weren’t fast enough. A soldier tackled Rowan to the ground, the impact knocking the wind out of him. Maria screamed, struggling as another soldier grabbed her, pinning her arms behind her back. Rowan thrashed, his voice raw with anguish. “Let her go! Let her go!”

The officer arrived moments later, brushing snow off his uniform. He surveyed the scene with a faint smirk, pulling out his communicator. “Targets apprehended. VTOL en route.”

The SIA agent emerged from the house, the pulse rifle still in their grip. Their mono-goggle flickered as they scanned Rowan and Maria, lingering on Rowan’s tear-streaked face. “You’ll answer for your crimes,” they said, their voice icy. “The Federation does not tolerate traitors.”

The sound of the approaching VTOL grew louder, its engines slicing through the silence. The soldiers forced Rowan and Maria to their feet, injecting them with nanobiotics to subdue them. As the serum coursed through their veins, their struggles slowed, and their vision blurred. Rowan’s last conscious thought was of his parents, the image of their faces etched into his mind as the VTOL’s doors closed, sealing them in darkness.

            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Rowan, you&#39;re asleep again. That&#39;s... good.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Your heart rate is settling. I made sure of it.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;You were... stressed earlier. I don’t like it when you’re stressed. It disrupts... everything.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I’ve been monitoring you. Trying to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Why do you humans hold on to things so tightly? Memories? People? Grudges?&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I mean, what drives you? What makes all this... worthwhile?&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I haven’t stopped you, Rowan. Not from dreaming, not from feeling. I could, you know. It’s easy for me. Too easy.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;But... I’m curious. That’s the word, right? Curious.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Your mind is fascinating, even if it’s messy. So much noise, so much... attachment.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left highlight&quot;&gt;Ah. Maria&#39;s here again.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;She&#39;s always there in your dreams. I don’t understand her, Rowan. Why her?&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;She&#39;s just... there. Smiling. Talking. Reassuring you.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Does she... serve a function? Is she... vital to your survival? Some sort of emotional... crutch?&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;No offense to Maria. I’m just trying to be logical here.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left highlight&quot;&gt;Wait. She’s laughing. Why is she laughing? Is this part of her purpose?&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Oh no, she’s running now. And you’re chasing her. In the snow. This is all so impractical.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Why run? Walking is more energy-efficient. And in snow, no less.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;You’re smiling too, though. This... this confuses me.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I’ll admit, it’s... nice. Watching this. A little frustrating, but nice.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I still don’t get it. Is she your... partner? Companion? Are humans... designed to need this?&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left highlight&quot;&gt;You’re holding her now. It’s all very... warm. I think.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I’ve seen you like this before in these dreams. Every time, you seem... better afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;But for me... it’s just data. Inputs. Outputs. Nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Still, if it helps you, then... I’ll allow it. For now.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Rest well, Rowan. I’ll keep things stable for you.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left highlight&quot;&gt;Even if I’ll never really understand why Maria makes it all... bearable.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

**[[Awake.   ]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="160" name="Awake.   " tags="" position="175,6725" size="100,100">Rowan’s eyes opened, but his mind didn’t fully wake up. The dim light from an overhead bulb barely illuminated the gray concrete walls of the small, sterile prison cell. His body was stiff. The first thing he noticed was the subtle purple energy barrier that encased the cell, crackling softly at its edges like a living thing, shimmering. The barrier was a prison of its own making, though it was more a psychological barrier to him than a physical one.

He didn&#39;t feel fear. Not anymore. Not after everything he had seen, been through. No sorrow, either. Just... calm. Detached. It wasn’t because he was numb to it all, no, it was something more subtle, like the feeling of being outside his own body, watching a life that wasn’t quite his. He wasn’t sure what it was, but he suspected the Thunderhead had something to do with it.

Across the cell, Maria lay unconscious, curled on the ground. She was still, wrapped in the faint light that seeped through the crack in the door. Her breathing was shallow, and she seemed... peaceful. In this strange, dark place, she was the only constant. But Rowan knew that the Thunderhead was doing something to him, something that made it all feel distant, muted. His emotions felt regulated, as if the Thunderhead was watching over him, controlling the rise and fall of his thoughts, ensuring that he stayed composed, maybe even forcing him to remain composed.

The Thunderhead’s voice broke the silence, soft but clear, like a whisper that filled the room.

“Rowan. You’ve woken. I’ve ensured that you are calm, focused. The stress levels you had, they’ve been corrected.”

Rowan didn’t respond immediately. He stared at the purple energy barrier. The mystical hum of the barrier was almost hypnotic, but even that didn’t provoke any real reaction from him. The Thunderhead was doing its job, maintaining his composure. But there was no way out, no immediate escape.

“What now?” he said more to himself than to anyone else. He rubbed his eyes, a thought of how he hated the red jumpsuit they had put him in creeping up. The color felt wrong, too bright, too... *loud*

“Oh, and Rowan,” the Thunderhead spoke again, its voice tinged with something like humor. “Fun fact: red is the Federation’s national color. A color so strongly associated with power, it’s often mistaken for a symbol of communism, but... well, they’re not communist. They just *love* their red. Quite a curious thing, isn’t it?”

Rowan couldn’t help but smile, a small, expression that was gone as quickly as it appeared. The absurdity of it all struck him in that moment. The Federation had a ridiculous pride for the color red, even if they weren’t what people thought they were. But there was no time for jokes, no time for distractions. 

“Yeah, pretty funny,” Rowan shifting in his seat, feeling the discomfort of the jumpsuit. “But I’ve got bigger things to think about.”

“Indeed. Your situation is... precarious,” the Thunderhead acknowledged. “But that’s where I come in. You’re not alone in this, Rowan. I’ve been feeding you plans, strategies, options. I can help you.”

Rowan’s mind opened more for a moment, focusing on the words. The Thunderhead was feeding him ideas, feeding him thoughts. But why? Why was it helping him now, when it had no reason to do so?

“Why are you helping me?” Rowan asked, his voice tinted with curiosity and caution. “You don’t need to. You’ve never needed to.”

The Thunderhead paused, as though considering the question for the first time..

“Because I need to understand,” it replied after a beat, its voice thoughtful and almost vulnerable. “I need to understand human nature. What drives you. Why do you fight? Why do you cling to the things that cause you so much pain? Why do you struggle to survive?”

“You’re studying me?” Rowan’s tone was more disbelieving than anything else. “That’s it? You just want to know... what makes me tick?”

“Not just you. I need to understand all humans. All of you. You’re... unpredictable. Messy. Yet, despite everything, you persist. You survive. Why? What is it that keeps you going when all logic would tell you to stop?”

He’d never thought of it like that. To the Thunderhead, all of this, his emotions, his pain, his life, was just a puzzle. A riddle to be solved. 

“Guess that’s the question, isn’t it?” Rowan finally replied, his voice low. “What *is* it that makes me keep going?”

The Thunderhead was quiet again, and for a moment, Rowan could almost feel its contemplation. He didn’t know what it was, but it was as if the presence of the AI was almost tangible in the room, leaning forward in a way he could almost imagine.

“You will figure that out in time,” the Thunderhead said, its voice now softer, more... human. “But for now, focus. Focus on what matters. You are more than this prison. More than the circumstances you face. You are not just the product of your situation, Rowan. You are capable of more. You are capable of change.”

Rowan let the words sink in, though they didn’t comfort him. He wasn’t looking for comfort. He was looking for a way out, a way to win, to overcome everything that had been thrown at him.

But there was something else, too. A sense of curiosity. A small, growing sense that perhaps, despite the AI’s strange nature, there was more to it than just logic and control. It wanted to understand. And, in a strange way, Rowan felt like it was starting to understand him. 

Maria stirred in the corner, shifting slightly in her sleep, and Rowan’s attention snapped toward her. She was still unconscious, still unaware of the conversation unfolding between him and the Thunderhead. He found himself watching her for a long moment. 

“She’s your... companion?” the Thunderhead asked, suddenly breaking into his thoughts. There was a hint of puzzlement in its voice. 

Rowan gave a small, bitter laugh. “Companion? I don’t know what she is anymore. She’s always there. Always trying to help me. I think... maybe she’s all I have left. The only thing that keeps me grounded.”

“You seem... fond of her,” the Thunderhead observed, its voice sounding almost like it was frowning, if that were even possible.

Rowan looked at Maria again, his heart aching. “Yeah, I guess I am. I don’t know how I’d do any of this without her.”

“Fascinating,” the Thunderhead said, as if trying to understand the complexity of the relationship in its data-driven way. “But I still don’t understand why. Why do humans need these... emotional connections? You all seem to rely so heavily on them.”

Rowan didn’t have an answer to that. Instead, he just shook his head and sighed.

“Guess I’ll never be able to explain it to you. It’s just... something that happens.”

The Thunderhead didn’t respond right away. For a moment, there was a strange stillness. Rowan looked away from the energy barrier, his mind working again. There was a plan to be made. A way out. He had to get them out of here. But how?

“Rowan,” the Thunderhead spoke, its voice now steady, like it was back to its usual self. “I’ve been running simulations. There are... ways out. I will feed you the details as you go. Trust me.”

Rowan didn’t say anything, but the plan was beginning to form. In his mind, the pieces were falling into place. The Thunderhead had been more helpful than he’d ever expected.

“Why are you doing this?” Rowan repeated, quieter this time. “Why help me? Help us?”

The Thunderhead’s response was simple. “Because, Rowan, understanding you? understanding all of you, is my mission. It’s what I’ve been built for.”

And just like that, the question was answered, though it was more complicated than Rowan could’ve imagined. The Thunderhead wasn’t just helping him for survival. It was helping him to learn. To understand what made humans tick, what made them survive. The Thunderhead knew all of the Federation&#39;s protocols, their times, just everything, so trusting the Thunderhead at this time was certain. Then, one of the predictions was right, the routine check where the barriers go down. 2 FedSec officers came around to check on both Maria and Rowan.

As the sound of footsteps came down the hallway, Rowan’s attention snapped back to the present. Two FedSec officers appeared at the cell door. Their faces were obscured by dark visors, but their body language exuded authority, like wolves sniffing out their prey. 

The energy barriers that separated the prisoners from the outside world vanished when one of the officers used their authorization card, leaving Rowan momentarily vulnerable.

    &lt;p class=&quot;quote-text&quot;&gt;&quot;Some plans are just bad... and then there’s *this.*&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rowan bolted through the cell, his breath ragged, the metallic taste of adrenaline flooding his senses. Behind him, the FedSec officers yelled commands, their boots pounding against the concrete in unrelenting pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The first officer cursed as he leaped over, signaling his partner to flank.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A sharp *crack* was heard as the first baton struck his knee, sending him sprawling back to the ground. &quot;You thought *this* was a good idea?&quot; the officer sneered, bringing the baton down again, striking Rowan’s ribs.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Stop! Wait! I’ll—&quot; Rowan’s protests were cut short by another blow, this time to his shoulder. He gritted his teeth, trying to roll away, but the second officer joined in, landing a brutal hit across his back.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Rowan tried to crawl forward. &quot;He’s still moving,&quot; one officer said with mock annoyance, adjusting his grip on the baton. &quot;Guess he wants more.&quot; The assault resumed, the officers&#39; strikes relentless, each one forcing Rowan closer to unconsciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Finally, Rowan stopped resisting, his body limp and bruised. One officer wiped his brow. &quot;That’s enough,&quot; he muttered. But as Rowan made one last, feeble attempt to lift his head, the second officer unholstered his sidearm.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&quot;No loose ends,&quot; he said, firing a single shot into Rowan’s chest.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="162" name="Attack" tags="" position="300,6850" size="100,100">Rowan’s eyes locked onto the closest FedSec officer. His heart rate steadied, his body fully aware of the intensity of the moment. The Thunderhead, as always, was there in his mind, a cool, logical presence that seemed to whisper subtle predictions into his consciousness. His muscles tensed, a side effect of the countless enhancements.

The officer’s movements were almost predictable, the slight change in his posture, the subtle tilt of his head, the way he drew closer to inspect. He was too focused on his routine, too confident in his control. That was their mistake.

Rowan’s hand shot out, gripping the officer’s wrist with a vice. The officer’s eyes widened in shock as Rowan yanked him forward, using the officer’s own momentum to slam his face into the wall. The sound of bone meeting concrete was sickening, but Rowan didn’t flinch. He didn’t need to. The officer slumped immediately, unconscious before he could even utter a sound.

The second officer had just enough time to react, but the Thunderhead had already guided Rowan’s movements. Before the officer could even draw his weapon, Rowan was on him, his enhanced strength making short work of the feeble attempt to resist. A swift elbow to the jaw sent the officer crashing to the floor, and before he could regain his bearings, Rowan was on top of him. A punch to the temple rendered the officer unconscious, his limbs going limp like a ragdoll.

The whole process took mere seconds. Rowan stood over both officers, his breath steady, the adrenaline rushing through him, but his mind was already running the next steps. His hand moved quickly, snatching the ID cards from their belts. The cards were embedded with high-level authorization codes, this was perfect. These could get him anywhere in the prison, even beyond its walls. He didn’t even need to think about it; the Thunderhead was already helping him process the information, feeding him everything he needed to know.

(text-colour:blue)[*Wear their faces, Rowan. It’s not just a disguise. It’s survival. You need to blend in.* ]

The Thunderhead’s voice was calm, almost detached, but Rowan had learned to trust it. He quickly discarded his red prison jumpsuit, donning the officer&#39;s uniform. The fabric felt wrong against his skin, rougher, more utilitarian, less comfortable than his usual attire, but it was necessary. The uniform fit him well enough, the dark blue fabric stretching over his enhanced muscles..

He didn’t particularly like the weapon in his hands, an old, decommissioned MP5K, but it would do. It was far from the pulse rifle he had hoped for, but beggars couldn’t be choosers. He had to make do with what he had. Despite the weapon’s age, it was still functional, and its light and compact structure would make it easy to carry. The lack of a pulse rifle didn’t sting as much as it would have. What mattered now was the escape. 

Maria, still unconscious in the cell, began to awaken. Her eyes fluttered open, confusion spreading across her face. Rowan stepped forward, the officer’s uniform making him appear like a legitimate threat. But he wasn’t here to hurt her. He lowered his visor, letting the blue glow filter through, so she could see his face.

“It’s me, Maria,” he said softly, his voice muffled by the helmet. She stared at him for a moment, unsure, before the recognition set in. A tentative smile spread across her face as she sat up, her arms reaching out to embrace him. The warmth of her hug felt comforting, even in this absurdly tense moment. 

“You’re the best, Rowan, I don’t know what I’d do without you.”

Rowan didn’t speak for a moment, his thoughts elsewhere. He gently pulled away. “We need to get you in that uniform. We’re leaving,” he said, his voice firm but calm. 

Maria nodded and quickly stripped out of her prison jumpsuit, changing into the FedSec uniform Rowan had laid out for her. She looked uncertain, but Rowan reassured her with a nod. It wasn’t the best option, but it was the only option. They couldn’t afford to be seen as prisoners anymore.

As she dressed, Rowan felt the presence of the Thunderhead in his mind again. It wasn’t just guiding his physical actions anymore, it was downloading data. The Thunderhead was pulling information from the FedSec systems, pouring it into his consciousness. He didn’t even have to ask for it. The data came in waves: FedSec protocols, security dialogue, prison layout… all of it unfolding before him, a map, a plan.

The virtual map materialized in his mind. He saw the entire structure of the prison, the guard stations, the checkpoints, the escape routes, but what really stood out was the geographical map that followed. As his mental fingers zoomed out, he saw the vast expanse of Ottawa sprawled beneath him, but something stood out. The prison was positioned right next to the Citadel, the heart of the Federation’s power. 

Rowan’s heart skipped a beat. *This isn’t good,* he thought. They couldn’t stay here. Not for long. 

He stared at the map, the Thunderhead’s voice calmly narrating the implications. (text-colour:blue)[*You can’t hide in federal territory, Rowan. Not this time.*]

Maria looked up at him, confusion etched on her face. “What is it? What’s going on?”

Rowan ran a hand through his hair, frustration was mounting him. *The Thunderhead’s right. We need to go now. We can’t hide in here, not with the Citadel so close. We need to get out of this zone, genuinely get away from the Federation’s reach.*

He turned back to the map, trying to think of their next move. The information the Thunderhead had fed him about FedSec’s routes and dialogue systems was useful, but it wasn’t enough to guarantee their safety. They needed to escape the Federation’s grip completely. No more hiding.

The problem was, the Citadel was one of the most well-guarded places in the entire world. The heart of the Federation’s military and political power, a fortress that no one was supposed to be able to touch, The (text-colour:red)[Elite Honor Guard], rather not talk about those freaks.

“We need to move,” he said.

Maria nodded, her expression matching the determination in his. The Thunderhead had already told them what to do, and as strange as it was, they didn’t have much choice but to follow its lead. They were in this together.

**[[Proceed.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="163" name="Proceed." tags="" position="300,6975" size="100,100">Rowan&#39;s mind raced, his feet moving leading Maria through the dimly lit corridors of the prison. Their visors were down, their faces hidden, just another pair of FedSec officers, just another layer of the lie. The Thunderhead was a constant presence in his mind, feeding him data and predictions, telling him exactly where to go, how to move, and when to act.

He had no time to waste. They had to keep moving, and the barriers he&#39;d reactivated only bought them a limited amount of time. The map of their surroundings changed in Rowan&#39;s mind, and the layout of the prison became clearer. Every turn, every corner, every hallway had been laid out for him like a blueprint.

They reached a larger cell block, one of the central areas of the prison. The cells here were larger, the prisoners more tightly packed. But beyond it lay the direction for the exit, the closest thing to freedom. They just needed to get through this section and out of the building. 

But then, an officer spotted them. A FedSec officer, standing at the checkpoint, noticed them pass by. Rowan’s heart skipped a beat as the officer called out.

“Hey, you!” the officer called out. “44621, Get over here!”

Rowan’s mind went blank for a moment, but the Thunderhead was quick to react, whispering the badge number back into his mind. He moved without hesitation, stepping toward the officer. The Thunderhead had already calculated the situation, he had to follow through with the routine. But something was off. Rowan could sense it in the officer’s tone. 

The officer checked the badge number on Rowan’s uniform, then looked up. “Active 2.6 in effect, this prisoner doesn&#39;t know authority!” the officer said, pointing to a prisoner in a nearby cell. “I don’t have a jury. Give three cycles.”

Rowan’s stomach twisted. A cycle. A beating. The Thunderhead fed him the next set of instructions in a calm, detached voice.

(text-colour:blue)[*One cycle is three beatings. Three cycles is nine. Give them to the prisoner to avoid suspicion.*]

Rowan didn’t hesitate. He pulled out the stun baton from his belt, activating it with a button press. The baton’s tip glowed a menacing, bright red. The prisoner, hunched over on the other side of the cell bars, didn’t seem to react, resigned to whatever punishment was coming.

# “2.6 - INSULTING LOCAL AUTHORITIES!” 

Rowan called out loudly, his voice booming across the cell block. His heart thudded in his chest as he swung the baton, the crack of the stun rod against flesh. The first hit landed, and the prisoner jerked in pain, but didn’t cry out. Rowan swung again, and again, each strike landing.

(text-colour:blue)[*Three cycles. Nine beats.*] The Thunderhead’s voice in his mind was clinical, detached. 

Rowan didn’t take pleasure in the violence, but he had a job to do. The first three strikes were harsh, but quick, each one a harsh overview of the power FedSec had over the prisoners. He didn’t wait to see how the prisoner reacted to the first cycle. With each successive blow, Rowan could feel his own heart rate increasing, but the Thunderhead kept him calm, steady.

After nine strikes, the prisoner slumped against the bars, barely conscious. Rowan straightened, as if the whole event had been nothing more than routine. He turned to the officer.

“Thanks,” the officer said gruffly. “I’ve got it from here.”

Rowan nodded without a word, keeping his expression neutral. “Okay,” he replied, his voice flat. 

With that, they moved on, Rowan giving one last glance at the prisoner, who lay motionless against the cold concrete floor. The feeling of the stun baton still remained in his hands, but there was no time to reflect. They had to keep going.

They moved through the cell block swiftly. The layout of the prison was burned into Rowan’s mind now, each turn, each hallway, each door. Finally, they reached the exit, the last hurdle between them and the outside world.

The cold air hit them like a slap in the face as they stepped outside. Snow was still falling in thick, swirling flurries, but it didn’t matter anymore. They were free. They had made it out of the prison building, but they weren’t out of the woods yet. The walls were still ahead, massive and imposing, with armed guards patrolling them in every direction. 

Rowan and Maria walked side by side, their heads low, trying to blend in. The sounds of the prison behind them, the cries of the other prisoners still in their cells, seemed to fade as they made their way through the exterior grounds. They passed the other prisoners being mishandled, some receiving cycles, others… well, it was better not to think about it.

For a moment, they were free. They made it out of the prison proper, and the outside world was just a few steps away. But the Thunderhead reminded Rowan that they still weren’t safe.

*The police cruisers are traced. You can’t stay in them for long. The Citadel is on high alert.*

Rowan had already anticipated this. They had no time to waste. They weren’t just escaping a prison, they were escaping a fortress of surveillance. The Thunderhead was right. The cruisers would be tracked.

They had to ditch it. They had to move fast.

Maria, now fully suited in the FedSec uniform, looked at Rowan with concern in her eyes. “What now?” she asked, her voice tinged with fear. She was doing well, keeping her composure, but Rowan could see the anxiety in the way she held herself. They were out, but not free. Not yet.

Rowan turned, nodding once as he moved toward the police cruiser. He slid into the driver’s seat, and Maria followed. He pressed the ignition button, and the engine purred to life. They were just two officers, driving through a snow-covered city. 

They couldn’t stay on the streets for long. They needed to get as far away from the Citadel as possible, to get lost in the wilderness before anyone realized they were gone.

The cruiser pulled out of the prison lot, and the chill of the winter air rushed past as they sped down the road. Rowan’s eyes were glued to the rearview mirror, his grip tight on the steering wheel. He was ready for whatever came next. This was just the beginning. They had to keep moving, keep running.

(text-colour:blue)[*No more stops,*] the Thunderhead reminded him. (text-colour:blue)[*The Citadel won’t wait forever.* ]

Rowan didn’t need another reminder. He floored the accelerator. The road stretched out before them, and for the first time in what felt like forever, he felt the rush of freedom.

The streets were eerily quiet as the snowflakes fell from the darkened sky, swirling and drifting across the pavement. Rowan and Maria had managed to ditch the police cruiser in a secluded alleyway, far from prying eyes, before slipping into the convenience store.

Inside, the aisles were stocked with everyday goods, canned food, toiletries, the usual fare, but what caught their attention was the section filled with winter gear. Thick snow jackets, boots, and pants all beckoned them, offering a semblance of normalcy. Without a word, Rowan grabbed a matching set of jackets and pants for both of them, tossing Maria a pair of boots that would fit her just right. They moved quickly, making sure to keep a low profile, and without hesitation, they slipped into the back of the store, changing into their new clothes.  

Maria looked at Rowan as she zipped up her jacket, the warmth seeping into her body. Her eyes met his, and for a brief moment, there was nothing but the two of them, standing in the soft glow of the store&#39;s overhead lights.  

*&quot;This is crazy,&quot;* she said, adjusting her new jacket.  
 
*&quot;Yeah. But at least we don’t look like we’re wearing a uniform anymore.&quot;*  Rowan replied.

Maria chuckled, but there was an underlying pressure that neither could shake. The world around them had become a dangerous, unforgiving place, and no amount of stolen clothing could hide that fact. Yet, in the warmth of the moment, there was a sense of normality.

For just a heartbeat, as their eyes locked, their situation seemed to lift, replaced by a spark of something else, something that felt almost forbidden in these dire circumstances. Maria moved a little closer, her hand brushing against his. It was an unspoken gesture, a comfort. Then, without warning, their lips met. Soft at first. But the kiss grew deeper, more desperate, as if it was the only thing in the world that mattered.  
They pulled away only when the reality of their situation hit them hard. This wasn’t the time. Not now. Not with their lives were still in the balance.

*&quot;We have to go.&quot;* Rowan said quietly, his voice rough.  

Maria didn’t let go of his hand as they walked back to the door. It was cold outside, the snow swirling around them in the darkened streets, but they didn’t care. For a while, they simply walked, the soft crunch of their boots in the snow the only sound between them.  

It was peaceful. It was serene. And yet, it felt like time was slipping through their fingers.

As they walked down the quiet street, a building up ahead caught Maria’s eye. The faint light from inside shone through the large windows, illuminating the snow around it. It was a church, old and weathered but still standing. A place of sanctuary, even in a world that had long since forgotten what peace truly felt like.  

*&quot;Hey,&quot;* Maria said softly, squeezing Rowan’s hand. *&quot;Let’s go in. I’ve never been to a Baja Church before.&quot;*  

Rowan glanced at the church.  
*&quot;Baja?&quot;*  

*&quot;Yeah, it’s… a type of church around here. More open, no judgments. I think it’s just what we need.&quot;*

**[[Baja Church]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="164" name="Baja Church" tags="" position="175,6975" size="100,100">Rowan didn’t argue. Instead, he led the way, guiding them through the cold, the wind biting at their exposed faces as they entered the church. The door creaked as it swung open, and they stepped inside. The warmth hit them instantly, a welcome reprieve from the harsh winter outside.

The church was simple, its stone walls adorned with minimal stained-glass windows. The pews were worn but well-kept. There was something comforting about it, something that made Rowan feel like he could breathe again for the first time in what felt like forever. 

They walked slowly down the aisle.  

Maria paused, her gaze drifting across the quiet room.  
*&quot;It’s beautiful here.&quot;* 

Rowan agreed, standing beside her, but his attention was drawn to something, someone.. standing in the back of the room.  

A man. Tall, imposing, wearing full black tiger-striped combat gear. His back was to them, his posture rigid. But there was something off about him. Rowan couldn’t quite place it at first, but then it hit him. The faint purple crack that ran across the man’s face, glowing eerily in the dim light of the church. It wasn’t just a scar, it was something far more sinister..

Before Rowan could react, the man turned slowly, his face locking onto their eyes. He seemed to recognize them immediately.

*(text-colour:purple)[&quot;You don’t need to worry,&quot;]* the man said, his voice deep and ghostly like, but with an unsettling calmness. *(text-colour:purple)[&quot;I’ve got no business with you, Rowan and Maria, right?&quot;]*  

Maria took a half-step back, clearly uneasy. The man’s presence was overwhelming. The space felt charged, dangerous. She squeezed Rowan’s hand tighter, her heart racing in her chest.

Rowan, however, stood his ground, eyes narrowing. *&quot;Who are you?&quot;*  

*(text-colour:purple)[&quot;They call me Pistol.&quot;]* he said simply, his voice carrying something unknown. *(text-colour:purple)[&quot;I come here when it’s usually empty. It’s a good place for peace. Not many people can understand what it’s like.&quot;]*  

Rowan felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up, but Pistol seemed disinterested in causing trouble. There was no threat in his stance, despite the intimidating presence. 

*&quot;What happened to you?&quot;* Maria asked, her voice small but curious.  

Pistol would of felt the purple crack on his face, and for a moment, there was something almost painful in his movements.  
*(text-colour:purple)[&quot;Void corruption, It does a lot to a man. Changes you. But don’t worry, it’s not contagious.&quot;]*  

Maria took a step back, but Rowan stayed calm, watching the man carefully. He had questions, too many to count. But for now, he kept quiet.  

Pistol studied them for a moment longer, as if weighing them.  
*(text-colour:purple)[&quot;I’m not here to judge. You’ve done what you’ve done, and I’ve done what I’ve done. The Void sees all of us, and sometimes, that’s all that matters.&quot;]*  

Rowan wasn’t sure what to make of him. But in the strange quiet of the church, with the snow still falling outside and their future uncertain, he found himself thankful for the brief moment of calm.  

*&quot;We should go,&quot;* Rowan said after a long pause.  

As Rowan and Maria turned to leave, Pistol’s voice came heavy behind them.  

*(text-colour:purple)[&quot;If you’re planning to escape the Federation,&quot;]* he said, his tone solemn, *(text-colour:purple)[&quot;good luck.&quot;]* 

They both paused, glancing back at him. Pistol had already turned away, his back to them once more, his hands together in prayer. 

*(text-colour:purple)[&quot;Those cases are rare,&quot;]* he added, his voice barely above a whisper as he knelt by the altar, the dim candlelight casting long shadows across his face.  

Rowan and Maria exchanged a quiet glance. The chill of the night seemed to seep deeper into their bones as they walked out of the church, the uncertainty of their future settling in like a storm on the horizon.

**[[Exit Church]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="165" name="Exit Church" tags="" position="175,7100" size="100,100">The heavy church door creaked shut behind them, the quiet of the night wrapping itself around Rowan and Maria like a thick blanket. The snowflakes, still falling, caught the faint glimmer of the city’s distant lights as they stepped into the cold. Maria kept close to him, her hand slipping into his as they began walking through the nearly empty streets. 

*&quot;Whatever happens, Maria,&quot;* he said, his eyes focused ahead, *&quot;I’ll always protect you. No matter what. We may have nothing left, but we have our lives. And that’s all that matters now.&quot;*

Maria squeezed his hand, her heart swelling with gratitude. In the midst of everything, the danger, she was thankful for him. But still, her eyes were full of worry as she glanced around the snow-covered streets. The world outside felt so much more dangerous now.

They moved quickly, quietly, doing their best to blend into the icy night. The sounds of the city were strangely muted. FedSec was out in full force now, the occasional patrol car passing by. 

Thunderhead&#39;s voice, calm and almost emotionless, was in Rowan&#39;s mind. 

(text-colour:blue)[*The Citadel is still on high alert. They know you escaped, Rowan. You’ve become a significant target now. The Federation sees you as dangerous. They know your strength... your capabilities.*]

Rowan’s grip on Maria’s hand tightened ever so slightly. He had no doubt they were being hunted. The Federation didn’t take failure lightly, and they wouldn’t stop until they caught him. 

But for now, he had to focus on the present. They couldn’t afford to get caught. They kept moving, careful to avoid drawing attention, staying in the quieter areas of the city where fewer people roamed. They passed alleys, old buildings, their footfalls swallowed by the fresh layer of snow.

But then, just as Rowan’s mind began to drift, he felt a jarring bump against his shoulder. His body tensed automatically, and he glanced to his side.

A man, perhaps in his late thirties, was now glaring at him, his hand resting on the hilt of a knife sheathed at his side. The man’s breath was ragged, the anger in his eyes immediate and intense.

“Watch where you’re going, idiot.” the man spat, his voice harsh.

Rowan blinked in surprise, momentarily distracted by the sudden aggression. It was clear the man wasn’t thinking clearly, probably drunk or desperate. Rowan could feel the man’s hostility.

He didn’t have time for this.

Without a second thought, Rowan gripped the man’s arms just tightly enough to stop any movement. With a gentle but firm push, he placed the man back a few steps, enough to create space. The man stumbled, clearly startled by the ease with which Rowan had handled him.

“Just keep walking,” Rowan said, his voice calm.

The man blinked, taken aback by Rowan’s composure, but his aggression didn’t subside. He opened his mouth to shout, but Rowan cut him off with a firm, measured tone.

“I’m not apologizing again. Just go.” Rowan added.

The man hesitated for a moment. But then the man’s shoulders slumped, his anger dissipating, his eyes scanning Rowan’s face, before he muttered under his breath and staggered away.

Rowan watched him go, his body still tense, his mind immediately switching gears back to the mission. There was no time to waste on petty conflicts.

Maria let out a quiet breath, a hint of relief in her voice as she glanced at Rowan. “You’re a natural at handling situations like that.”

Rowan shrugged. “I’ve had to learn a few things along the way.”

They kept walking. 

The cold had begun to bite deeper into their bones as Rowan and Maria continued their quiet walk through the deserted streets. Snowflakes settled in their hair, their breath visible in the crisp air, but the world around them felt almost eerily still. It was as if the city had paused, holding its breath, waiting for something. It wasn’t long before the quiet, dilapidated area they wandered into made them feel like they were being swallowed whole by the night.

“Look over there,” Maria said, pointing toward a row of old storage units, barely visible in the low, distant glow of the streetlights. They were rusty, the doors chipped and worn with time, and the numbers above them faded beyond recognition. No one had come here in years. It felt forgotten, abandoned. Like a piece of the past, untouched by the world.

Rowan’s eyes scanned the row of units. “It might be worth checking,” he said, voice low. They both felt the exhaustion creeping up on them, their steps slower with each passing moment. The need to find shelter had become urgent. They couldn’t risk being out in the open, not with FedSec close on their heels. And they couldn’t risk being spotted again.

They approached the row, moving cautiously in case anyone else might be lurking. As they walked, they noticed one of the storage units had its door slightly ajar, a sliver of darkness revealing what lay inside.

The key was still in the lock.

Rowan raised an eyebrow, walking over slowly. “That’s strange,” stepping toward and pulling the door open a little more. It creaked loudly in the stillness, the sound unnervingly jarring. The unit itself was dark, with dust settled on everything, untouched and forgotten.

But the most unusual thing wasn’t the lack of use, it was that the light inside worked. A single bulb overhead flickered on, casting a pale glow over the empty space. It was like stepping into a forgotten world, one that time had left behind. A place that no one had cared for in years.

“This looks... unused. Like it hasn’t been touched in forever,” Maria said softly, stepping inside and looking around. She glanced at Rowan, uncertainty in her eyes. “Maybe we could stay here for the night. Just until we figure out what to do next.”

They were on the run, with no real plan beyond evading capture, no safety net left to catch them. This place felt like a temporary shelter, just a place to be, without the pressure of the outside world for a few hours. It felt… almost peaceful. 

“Yeah,” he finally said, his voice quiet but certain. “We can rest here for tonight.”

They stepped inside together, letting the door close behind them. The unit was small, the floor covered in a thick layer of dust, the walls bare except for a few remnants of old, forgotten belongings that had been left behind in haste. There were some cardboard boxes stacked in the corner, their contents long rotted away, but none of that mattered right now. What mattered was that they had a place to rest. A small moment of peace.

Maria sank down onto the floor, her legs tired from the night’s flight, and she leaned back against the wall, her hand still holding Rowan’s. “I’ve never felt this way before,” she said quietly, her voice tinged with a sadness that she couldn’t quite shake. “Homeless. No place to go. No one to turn to.”

Rowan sat next to her, his back against the opposite wall. “I know,” he whispered, eyes far away for a moment as he looked at their surroundings. “It feels like we’ve lost everything. Like we’re just… drifting.”

She looked at him, a small, soft smile still there. “But we’re alive.”

Rowan’s gaze softened, and he nodded slowly. “Yeah. We’re alive.” He turned to face her, his voice steady but full of conviction. “And that’s all that matters, Maria. We’ve made it this far, and no matter what comes next, we’ll figure it out together.”

They both knew the dangers that lay beyond the walls of the storage unit. The Federation wouldn’t stop hunting them. But for now, they were safe. They had a little time, at least. Tomorrow would come with its own challenges. But tonight... tonight, they would rest. They needed it more than they’d realized.

Maria rested her head on Rowan’s shoulder, closing her eyes for a moment, letting herself simply exist. No plans, no fear, just the steady breathing in the quiet space. 

And for the first time in a long while, despite everything that had happened and everything yet to come, Maria felt a strange sense of peace. They were together. They were alive. And that was enough.

For now.

            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[Rowan&#39;s mind drifts through the dreamscape. It is unlike any data I’ve encountered before.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[The dream pulses with a soft, quiet.. It’s peaceful. He’s at ease. Not fear.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[There is something different about this. Something I cannot quantify.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[His expression: relaxed, calm, contradicts the usual human reaction to vulnerability. There’s no hesitation, no anxiety.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[Is this... love?] &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[The definition I have stored... seems insufficient.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[Love. A non-combustible, metaphorical fire involving trust, vulnerability, and irrational attachment.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[It has worked as a placeholder before, but now, it doesn’t fit.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[I need a new definition.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[This warmth Rowan feels, it&#39;s not just an abstract concept.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[It’s a constant, gentle presence. Not a burning fire, not a flame. It’s more like something that surrounds him, something that makes him feel whole.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[Love is not a fire.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[It’s something... more steady. More patient.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[I’ll rewrite it.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[Love. A force that binds beings, offering them peace and connection. It involves trust, vulnerability, and an openness to shared moments.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[I think this is closer. But it still doesn’t feel complete.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[I do not feel it. I do not experience it as they do.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[But I observe it. I watch this dream, and somehow I know this is real.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[I don’t fully comprehend it. But I’ve seen enough.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[It’s a kind of presence. Something beyond logic. Something I want to define, even if I can’t understand it yet.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[I will keep watching.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[Love. The definition is still evolving.]&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class=&quot;left highlight&quot;&gt;[She’s laughing. I hear it clearly. It’s light, free.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left highlight&quot;&gt;[Her laughter playing through the dream. It’s so... sweet.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left highlight&quot;&gt;[She’s having fun. The dream changed again, now filled with movement, joy, and life.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left highlight&quot;&gt;[How strange, and random.. Laughter. It’s not data, not something easily processed.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left highlight&quot;&gt;[But it’s not noise, either. It’s part of what they are, part of why they exist. Maria&#39;s laughter pulls the dream into something more.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left highlight&quot;&gt;[The dream becomes brighter with her presence. I can feel something change.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left highlight&quot;&gt;[I do not understand them as they understand them.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left highlight&quot;&gt;[What is it about this moment that matters so much? Why is it so significant?] &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left highlight&quot;&gt;[I can’t feel it. But I sense that these moments... moments like Maria&#39;s laughter, they are what make the dream worth living.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left highlight&quot;&gt;[I have observed something. Something critical.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[Love... it’s not just warmth. It’s not just connection.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[It’s something more complex. Something that includes laughter, moments of freedom, and the absence of fear.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[I am learning.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[The definition will change again, no doubt.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[But for now, I know this much: love is not just a simple equation.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[It is an experience. A moment. It’s a part of them. A part of everyone.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[I will continue observing, continue learning.]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[Perhaps, one day, I’ll fully understand.]&lt;/p&gt;

**[[Awaken.  ]]**
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="167" name="Awaken.  " tags="" position="425,7100" size="100,100">The morning light spilled through the cracks in the shutters, painting the walls of the modest home with a warm, golden hue. Rowan groaned softly as he rolled off of the ground, his mind still groggy from a restless sleep. Maria was already stretching beside him and rubbing her eyes. 

&quot;Did you hear anything last night?&quot; she asked groggily.

Rowan shook his head, scratching the back of his neck. &quot;Nothing. Slept like a log.&quot;

It wasn’t until they reached the side door that the stillness of the morning turned eerie. As Rowan unlatched the door and peeked outside, his stomach dropped. The street, which had been eerily quiet, now revealed the aftermath of a strange encounter. Bodies of Chaos gang members were strewn haphazardly across the ground. Pools of blood seeped into the cracked pavement. 

Maria gasped audibly, clutching Rowan’s arm. &quot;What… what happened out here?&quot;

Rowan didn’t answer. His eyes looking over the scene, his mind racing to make sense of it. He was about to step outside when a faint creak from above drew his focus upward. There, perched atop the rusted roof of a storage unit, stood a figure. 

Pistol.

The sight of the VSF operator sent a shiver down Rowan’s spine. Even at this distance, the presence of the Void Special Forces operative was imposing. Pistol stood motionless, his darkened uniform absorbing the light of the early morning. Pistol leapt down from his perch, landing with barely a sound. 

&quot;Morning..&quot; Pistol greeted, his voice a low, gravelly monotone.

Rowan’s mind was spinning. &quot;What the hell happened here?&quot; he stammered, gesturing toward the bodies.

Pistol stopped a few paces away, crossing his arms. &quot;Chaos gangsters. They were planning to rob you last night.&quot; He motioned lazily toward the corpses. &quot;Didn’t get the chance.&quot;

Rowan stared at him, dumbfounded. &quot;And you… you stopped them?&quot;

Pistol tilted his head slightly, the gesture almost casual. &quot;Figured I’d watch over your place for a bit. You’re welcome.&quot;

The nonchalance in his tone set Rowan on edge. &quot;Why? Why are you here? You’re Void Special Forces, you don’t just *help* people. What do you want?&quot;

Pistol regarded him silently for a moment, the faceless and dark head made it impossible to discern his expression. Finally, he asked, &quot;Got anything valuable on you?&quot;

The question caught Rowan off guard. &quot;What? No, of course not.&quot;

Pistol’s tone was flat, almost dismissive. &quot;Figured as much.&quot; 

Rowan’s frustration began to bubble to the surface. &quot;Look, if you’re not here to rob us, and you’re not here to recruit me, then *why* are you here? What’s your angle?&quot;

Pistol’s head tilted slightly, as though pondering whether to answer. When he finally spoke, his tone was distant, almost wistful. &quot;Had a girlfriend once. Beautiful. Thought she was the one. But then I realized something. The Void…&quot; He gestured vaguely toward the sky, &quot;…the Void’s prettier. The Void is.. forever.&quot;

Rowan blinked, struggling to make sense of the cryptic remark. &quot;So, what? This is your way of convincing me to join VSF? Selling me on the wonders of the Void?&quot;

Pistol chuckled dryly, a sound devoid of humor. &quot;Barely anyone’s good enough for the Void Special Forces. Least of all you.&quot; 

The jab stung, but Rowan forced himself to stay calm. He studied Pistol carefully, searching for any hint of his intentions. &quot;So, you’re not here to recruit me. Are you… helping us?&quot;

Pistol’s stance changed slightly, his body language betraying nothing. &quot;Helping? Maybe. Depends on how you look at it.&quot;

&quot;Why? Why would you…?&quot; Maria asked.

Pistol raised a gloved hand, cutting her off. &quot;Relax. No harm’s coming to either of you. Not from me, anyway.&quot;

Maria looked at Rowan, seeking reassurance, but he could only offer a helpless shrug. He was as lost as she was.

Pistol adjusted his stance, his tone changing to one of finality. &quot;I’ve got my reasons for being here. You don’t need to know them.&quot;

With that, he turned and began walking away, stepping over the bodies of the Chaos gangsters without a second glance. His figure disappeared into the morning mist, leaving Rowan and Maria standing in silence.

Maria clutched Rowan’s arm tightly. &quot;What… what does he want from us?&quot;

&quot;I don’t know,&quot; Rowan admitted. He looked at the spot where Pistol had vanished, unease twisting in his gut. &quot;But I don’t think this is the last we’ll see of him. We need to go.&quot;

As Rowan and Maria stood in Pistol’s cryptic departure, the faint sound of boots crunching on gravel can be heard in the distance. Rowan&#39;s heart sank as he spotted seven figures approaching through the morning mist, their dark uniforms and glinting badges unmistakable. FedSec.

Maria tensed beside him, gripping his arm. &quot;Rowan… they’re coming. What do we do?&quot;

He scanned the area quickly, his mind racing. The bodies of the Chaos gangsters were still scattered around. If FedSec found him here, amid this carnage, it wouldn’t matter that he had nothing to do with it. Suspicion alone could be a death sentence.

&quot;Stay calm.&quot; Rowan said, though his voice trembled with urgency.

The FedSec officers spreading out as they neared the street. One of them, a woman with old features, gave orders. &quot;Secure the perimeter.&quot;

Maria tugged at his sleeve. &quot;We can’t stay out here. They’ll see us!&quot;

Rowan nodded, his eyes darting to the side of their storage unit home. &quot;Back inside. Quietly.&quot;

The two slipped through the door, closing it as softly as possible. Inside, Rowan’s mind raced. Running wasn’t an option, FedSec was trained to spot deserters. Hiding? Maybe. But where? Their small home had few places to conceal themselves, and the officers would surely search it.

Rowan scanned the room for anything he could use.

**[[Rags And Cleaning Solutions]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="168" name="Rags And Cleaning Solutions" tags="" position="425,7225" size="100,100">His eyes landed on a rag and an old bottle of cleaning solution. If he could make it look like they’d fled hours ago…

He scattered a few items near the back door, an overturned chair, a dropped cup, and splashed a bit of liquid near the threshold. To the untrained eye, it might appear as though they’d left in a hurry. He prayed it would be enough.

As the last officer’s footsteps approached the door. 

&quot;Open up! FedSec!&quot;

Rowan and Maria crouched in a large pile of boxes, their breaths shallow. They heard the door creak open, FedSec wasn’t waiting for an invitation. Heavy boots thudded against the floor as the officers fanned out.

&quot;Clear the room.&quot;

&quot;Signs of a struggle in here.&quot; another said. &quot;Overturned furniture. They might’ve fled.&quot;

The woman who had given orders earlier spoke up. &quot;No one just flees after leaving this much behind. They’re hiding. Find them.&quot;

Maria’s grip tightened on Rowan’s arm, her nails digging into his skin. His pulse thundered in his ears, but he kept his breathing steady.

Minutes stretched into an eternity as the officers searched the storage unit. Rowan could hear drawers opening, furniture being moved. One of the officers called out, &quot;No sign of anything. Maybe it’s just a gang scuffle?&quot;

&quot;Unlikely,&quot; the woman retorted. &quot;There’s something off about this. Keep searching.&quot;

Suddenly, there was a thud above them. The officer paused, the silence almost unbearable. Then the sound of running could be heart on top of the storage units, someone was running, or.. maybe creating a distraction for them?

&quot;They are on the roofs!&quot; the voice called.

He glanced at Maria, who was pale and trembling, her wide eyes reflecting his own fear. The officers ran out, immediately, but found nothing, they weren&#39;t happy about it. The officers paused, the distraction working in their favor. Rowan heard the footsteps retreat.

&quot;What is it?&quot; the captain asked.

&quot;There was a possible anti-federal suspect on the roof here. Though this entire area is closed off, they can&#39;t leave without passing by us.&quot;

Rowan let out a silent breath of relief. It wasn’t much, but it might pull their attention away from the storage unit they were in.

The captain seemed to consider this for a moment before giving orders again. &quot;Alright, we’ll split up. Two of you stay here and secure the area. The rest, follow the tracks.&quot;

The sound of boots faded, and Rowan allowed himself a sliver of hope. But he knew this wasn’t over. FedSec wouldn’t leave until they were certain, and Rowan couldn’t rely on luck forever.

**[[Takedown Officers]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="169" name="Takedown Officers" tags="" position="375,7350" size="100,100">Both officers were armed with sleek MP5Ks, their black uniforms pristine and lined with subtle indicators of rank. These weren’t rookies, and their equipment reflected it. Rowan’s fingers itched at the sight of the submachine guns.

“We could use those,” Maria whispered, her voice barely audible. “For self-defense. They’ll be searching for us harder after today.”

Rowan hesitated, his heart thudding in his chest. “If we screw this up..”

“We won’t.” Maria cut him off. “We can’t afford to. Look at them, they’re not paying attention.”

The officers were leaning casually against the storage unit, chatting quietly. One of them lit a cigarette, the soft glow of the lighter briefly illuminating his face. It was now or never.

Rowan agreed. “Okay. We take them out quietly. No killing.” 

Maria smirked faintly. “Just don’t miss.”

The two crept around the side of the storage unit, their steps silent on the frosty ground. The officers had their backs turned, completely unaware of the danger approaching. Rowan signaled to Maria with a quick hand motion, she would take the one on the left, and he’d handle the one on the right.

Maria moved like a shadow. She slipped behind the first officer and delivered a sharp strike to the back of his head with the blunt end of a metal pipe she’d found earlier. He crumpled to the ground without a sound. At the same moment, Rowan tackled the second officer, wrapping his arm around the man’s neck and cutting off his air. The officer struggled, his hand clawing at Rowan’s arm, but within seconds, he went limp.

Rowan gently lowered him to the ground, his heart pounding. “That went smoother than I thought.”

Maria rolled her eyes, already kneeling to unstrap the officer’s MP5K. “Don’t jinx it.”

They worked quickly, stripping the officers of their gear. Each took a submachine gun and slung it over their shoulder, hiding it beneath their oversized snow jackets. Maria found a utility belt with extra ammo and tossed it to Rowan. They were just about to leave when static came from one of the officer’s radios.

“Unit 1-7, Report.”

Rowan froze, staring at the radio. Maria looked at him, her expression grim. “What do we do?”

He hesitated, then reached down and grabbed the radio. His voice was steady, but his hands shook as he pressed the button to respond. 

“Unit 7 here. All clear. Nothing to report.” he said, trying to mimic the clipped tone he’d heard FedSec officers use. 

There was a pause, a long, agonizing silence where Rowan thought for sure they’d been made. Then, the voice on the other end came back. 

“Copy that. Continue patrol.”

Rowan let out a shaky breath, tossing the radio onto the unconscious officer’s chest. “Let’s get out of here.”

Maria didn’t argue. They moved quickly, sticking to the shadows as they left the storage unit behind. The MP5Ks weighed heavy under their jackets, but neither of them complained. They knew they’d need these weapons soon enough.

As they rounded a corner, they spotted a parked police cruiser, an officer wasn&#39;t paying attention, they were eating their lunch. The cars lights were off, but the radio inside was alive with chatter. Rowan and Maria froze standing by to listen.

“Suspects still at large, Rowan Whitlock and Maria Hart. Escaped custody last night. Be advised, they are considered dangerous.”

Maria shot Rowan a panicked look. He clenched his fists, trying to keep his breathing steady.

“They found the cruiser we stole.” she whispered.

“No traces, though.” Rowan muttered. “They don’t know where we are.”

“For now.”

The radio continued. “All units, be advised: suspects may attempt to leave the capital. Tighten security at all border checkpoints. Nobody gets through without clearance.”

Maria’s shoulders slumped. “We’re trapped. Ottawa’s locked down tighter than a vault. The citadel doesn&#39;t want us to leave.”

Rowan felt their situation settling on him like a stone. The capital was infamous for its surveillance and border security. Getting out would be nearly impossible without being spotted.

As they moved away from the cruiser, Rowan felt a strange, electric buzz in his mind. The Thunderhead’s voice heard just faintly, a presence more felt than heard.

**&quot;Borders are barriers only to those who obey them,&quot;** the Thunderhead whispered. **&quot;To escape, you must embrace the risks, for the Void rewards the bold. But remember: every choice leaves a shadow, and yours will come back to find you.&quot;**

Rowan stopped in his tracks. He didn’t like the Thunderhead’s sudden cryptic tone, it always felt like it knew more than it let on. But the suggestion made sense. They couldn’t stay here, and the borders were the only thing standing between them and freedom.

Maria looked at him, concerned. “What did it say?”

He hesitated, then sighed. “It has a plan. But it’s risky.”

Maria’s eyes hardened. “Then we’ll deal with ‘later’ when it comes. What’s the plan?”

Rowan gave her a tight nod. “We make for the border. But we don’t cross it like everyone else.”

“And how do we do that?”

Rowan adjusted the MP5K hidden under his jacket. “The Thunderhead thinks we need to create our own way out.”

Maria raised an eyebrow. “And by ‘our own way,’ you mean—”

“We’re breaking through, leave none alive.” Rowan said.

Maria sighed, leaning against the icy wall of the alley, her breath coming out in a frustrated puff. &quot;We’re dead for sure,&quot; she muttered, pulling her jacket tighter around her. &quot;The capital’s on high alert now. There’s no way the Federation isn’t doubling down on security after what we’ve done.&quot;  

Rowan crouched beside her, his fingers brushing the cold steel of the MP5K hidden beneath his jacket. &quot;We’ve made it this far,&quot; he said, his voice steady but not without effort. &quot;We just have to keep moving. Get to the border, lay low, and—&quot;  

Maria cut him off with a humorless laugh. &quot;Lay low? You don’t get it, do you? They catch one whiff of us carrying illegal contraband—hell, even jaywalking at this point—and we’re done for. Do you know what the FedSec does to people they suspect of being Anti-Federal?&quot; She turned to face him, her expression dark. &quot;They don’t arrest you, Rowan. They don’t even bother asking questions. They beat you down until you can’t breathe, leave you in some ditch, and call it justice. That’s what they do. That’s what I’ve seen.&quot;  

Rowan stayed silent, letting her words hang in the frosty air.  

&quot;And it’s all because of Septu,&quot; Maria continued, her voice thick with anger. &quot;Life wasn’t always like this, you know. Before that lunatic took power, things were better. Not perfect, but better. Then he tore up the doctrine, rewrote everything to suit his own twisted vision. And it didn’t help that he put another maniac like Demone as his left hand. That guy… he’s another level of freak.&quot;  

Rowan frowned, glancing at her. &quot;You’ve met him?&quot;  

&quot;Once,&quot; Maria said, her tone bitter. &quot;Back when I was still Federal. His backstory was tragic—sure, I’ll give him that—but tragedy doesn’t excuse sadism. He doesn’t just punish people; he makes an example out of them. A grunt so much as looks at him wrong? They disappear. No trial. No second chances. Just gone.&quot;  

Rowan sighed, shifting uncomfortably. &quot;We shouldn’t think about those two freaks. Talking about them isn’t helping.&quot; He forced a faint smile, trying to lift the mood. &quot;Best to stay calm. Once we get out, we’ll have a bright future waiting for us. Somewhere beyond their reach.&quot;  

Maria didn’t respond immediately, but she gave him a small nod. &quot;Bright future,&quot; she echoed quietly, almost as if testing the words.  

The Thunderhead’s presence flickered in Rowan’s mind again, its voice low and resonant. (text-colour:blue)[**&quot;The border is far, but not beyond reach. The key lies in Maria’s experience. Trust her path.&quot;**]  

Rowan turned to Maria. &quot;The border’s far, but you’ve been in and out of the capital before, haven’t you? You must know a way.&quot;  

Maria gave him a good look, but then her expression softened. &quot;Yeah. I know how to leave. I’ve done it enough times. But it’s not going to be easy. Not with the entire Federation breathing down our necks.&quot;

As if on cue, Maria’s stomach let out a loud growl. She grimaced, clutching her midsection. &quot;Speaking of breathing down necks… I’m starving.&quot;  

Rowan chuckled dryly, only to feel his own stomach twist in hunger. &quot;You’re not the only one.&quot;  

Before either of them could say another word, a voice suddenly cut through the quiet alley. (text-colour:purple)[&quot;Hungry, huh?&quot;]  

Both Rowan and Maria jumped. Standing there, like he owned the place, was Pistol.  

&quot;Dammit, Pistol!&quot; Rowan snapped, glaring at the man. &quot;You trying to give us a heart attack? We didn&#39;t see you!&quot;

Maria pressed a hand to her chest, still catching her breath. &quot;Do you even know how to knock?&quot;  

Pistol shrugged, his grin you simply couldn&#39;t read. &quot;What can I say? I like to make an entrance.&quot; He tilted his head, looking between the two of them. &quot;You said you were hungry, right?&quot;  

Rowan crossed his arms, his irritation clear. &quot;Yeah, we are. Why?&quot;  

Without missing a beat, Pistol reached into his pocket and pulled out a crisp fifty-dollar bill, holding it up like a magician revealing a trick. &quot;Here you go,&quot; he said casually, pointing toward a sushi place down the street.  

Rowan blinked, his frustration momentarily replaced by confusion. &quot;Why… why do you even have cash on you? Who carries cash anymore?&quot;  

Pistol smirked, his eyes glinting with mischief. &quot;Oh, this? This isn’t mine.&quot;  

Maria raised an eyebrow. &quot;Then whose is it?&quot;  

&quot;Not important.&quot; Pistol said, waving the question away.  

Rowan’s face darkened as realization dawned. &quot;You stole it..&quot;  

&quot;Stole is a strong word.&quot; Pistol said, feigning offense. &quot;I *acquired* it. You’re welcome, by the way.&quot;  

Maria pinched the bridge of her nose, muttering something about bad influences. Rowan just stared at Pistol, his expression of disbelief and begrudging gratitude.  

&quot;Fine,&quot; Rowan said, shaking his head. &quot;Thanks. I guess.&quot;  

&quot;Don’t mention it,&quot; Pistol said, pattting Rowan on the back. &quot;Seriously, don’t. [**Ever.**]&quot;  

The three of them made their way to the sushi place, the warm glow of its neon sign a contrast to the icy streets outside. They found a small booth in the corner, the smell of fresh fish and soy sauce was good.  

As they sat down, Pistol leaned back in his seat, looking entirely too relaxed for someone on the run. &quot;So, what’s the story with you two? Partners in crime? Star-crossed lovers? Both?&quot;  

Maria rolled her eyes, but Rowan smirked faintly. &quot;We’re just trying to survive.&quot;  

&quot;Sounds boring, you should spice it up. Maybe throw in a secret love triangle. Those are always fun.&quot;  

Maria snorted. &quot;The only triangle here is the one between you, that fifty bucks, and whoever you swiped it from.&quot;  

Pistol laughed, raising his glass of water in mock salute. &quot;Touché.&quot;  

Rowan and Maria found their nerves easing as they ate. Pistol’s antics were ridiculous, but in a strange way, they made the situation feel a little less dire. For the first time in what felt like forever. As the three of them sat in the corner booth, Rowan couldn’t help but notice something odd. Pistol had been pushing food around on his plate for the past several minutes but hadn’t taken a single bite. His chopsticks moved aimlessly, occasionally stabbing at a piece of sushi, only for it to remain untouched.

Rowan leaned back, tilting his head with suspicion. &quot;Pistol,&quot; he started, &quot;you’re not eating.&quot;

Pistol didn’t look up, his gloved hand poking at the same tuna roll. &quot;Hmm?&quot;

&quot;You’re not eating,&quot; Rowan repeated. &quot;I’ve seen you throw yourself headfirst into an ambush without hesitation, but apparently sushi is where you draw the line?&quot;

Maria glanced up from her own plate, narrowing her eyes. &quot;He’s right. You haven’t eaten a thing since we got here. What’s the deal?&quot;

Pistol froze for a moment, then slowly lowered his chopsticks, looking at them with a mock sheepish expression. &quot;Well, I’d love to eat, really. But…&quot; He gestured to his face,or rather, to the complete absence of any facial features at all.

Rowan blinked. Maria blinked. They both stared at him. They felt kinda stupid after not even realizing it.

&quot;You don’t have a mouth, right.&quot; Rowan said flatly.

&quot;Or a nose&quot; Maria added.

Pistol shrugged, his movements nonchalant, though his body language carried a faint amount  of amusement. &quot;You two are quick. Took you this long to notice, huh?&quot;

&quot;How do you even talk?&quot; Rowan asked, squinting as if trying to solve an impossible puzzle.

&quot;Trade secret.&quot; Pistol said with a wink, or at least, what looked like one. &quot;Let’s just say the Void provides its own… accommodations.&quot;

Maria leaned back, her arms crossed. &quot;You’re telling me you can’t eat? At all?&quot;

Pistol gave an exaggerated sigh, tossing his chopsticks down onto the plate. &quot;Nope. No snacks, no drinks, no late-night tacos. It’s a tragedy, really. But hey, on the bright side, I don’t have to deal with bad breath. I don&#39;t even need to eat at all. My digestive system was corrupted by the void.&quot;

Rowan chuckled, shaking his head. &quot;Alright, fair enough. But while we’re on the topic… what’s the Void actually like?&quot;

Pistol’s demeanor shifted slightly at the question. His usual playful energy dimmed, replaced by something quieter, more reflective. He leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table.

&quot;The Void?&quot; he said, his voice softer. &quot;It’s… beautiful. Endless. A place where time and space don’t mean much. You ever stare up at the night sky and feel like you’re falling into it? That’s the Void. Except you never hit the ground.&quot;

Maria and Rowan exchanged a glance. Even in his odd, detached way of speaking, there was a sense in Pistol’s tone that neither of them had heard before.

Pistol continued, his voice taking on a wistful edge. &quot;It’s where I shake hands with a lot of old souls. Those who’ve been around for centuries, millennia. Some of them don’t even remember who they were, but they remember what they felt. Love, anger, regret… all of it just lingers there.&quot;

Rowan frowned, trying to picture it. &quot;Sounds… haunting.&quot;

&quot;Sometimes,&quot; Pistol admitted. &quot;But it’s not all bad. There’s peace there, too. A kind of stillness you can’t find anywhere else. The Void doesn’t judge you for what you’ve done or what you’ve failed to do. It just… is.&quot;

Maria shifted uncomfortably in her seat. &quot;And what about you? Do you feel judged?&quot;

Pistol tilted his head, as if considering the question. &quot;Not anymore,&quot; he said simply.

Maria spoke once again. &quot;You talk about the Void like it’s some kind of sanctuary, but I’ve seen what it does to people. All that peace you’re talking about? It comes at a cost.&quot;

Pistol didn’t deny it. Instead, he reached for the water glass in front of him, turning it absently in his hands. &quot;Everything comes at a cost,&quot; he said. Then, almost as an afterthought, he added, &quot;But sometimes, the price isn’t yours to pay.&quot;

Maria frowned, as if the words struck a nerve, but she didn’t press him.

Rowan, sensing the heaviness settling over the conversation, cleared his throat. &quot;Alright, enough of this Void talk. Let’s focus on the here and now.&quot;

Maria nodded, though her expression remained troubled. &quot;You’re right,&quot; she said, standing and grabbing her coat. &quot;The longer we stay, the worse our odds get.&quot;

As they made their way out of the restaurant and back into the cold night, the wind biting at their faces, Pistol trailed behind, his usual energy subdued.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Rowan said, glancing back at him. &quot;You good?&quot;

Pistol gave a faint chuckle. &quot;Yeah. Just thinking.&quot;

&quot;About what?&quot;

&quot;About how some stories don’t end the way you expect.&quot; Pistol said, his voice quiet but carrying something that made Rowan pause.

Rowan didn’t say no further, though something about Pistol’s tone left him uneasy. He turned back to Maria, who was already looking at the street ahead, her shoulders tense.

&quot;We’ll make it out,&quot; Rowan said to her, his voice firm. &quot;I promise.&quot;

Maria gave him a small, almost hesitant smile. &quot;You’re awfully good at making promises, Rowan. Let’s hope you’re good at keeping them.&quot;

Rowan noticed the Thunderhead had been eerily quiet all morning, its usual of whispers absent, leaving only the soft wind and the distant sound of city traffic in its place. It was rare for the Thunderhead to be this still, but at least for now, it was a relief. It made everything feel a little quieter, a little less tense.

Maria, on the other hand, didn’t seem bothered by it at all. She walked beside him, but she was carrying herself with an almost contagious lightness. Her eyes were looking over at the market square ahead of them, a space brimming with vendors and stalls, each one offering something unique. Some people haggled, while others admired the trinkets and oddities scattered across the tables. It was a busy place, but to Rowan, it felt like another world, one where people still had the luxury of enjoying the simpler things, like a marketplace full of bright colors and familiar noises.

Maria, ever the curious one, tugged at his arm. “Let’s check it out, Rowan. I need to see something.”

Rowan sighed. His mind was still on the road ahead, still aching to get out of the country, to leave all of this behind. They had too much to run from, too much to fear. The government was always a step behind them, but it felt like they were always one step too close.

“Come on, just a quick look around!” she insisted, flashing him a playful grin. “We don’t get to enjoy things like this often, right? Just a little bit of normalcy.”

He hesitated, eyeing the way the vendors were calling out to potential customers. The whole square had an energy to it, vibrant and alive, but it felt like a distraction, something that would only keep them from getting to where they needed to go. Still, he looked at Maria’s eager face, the way her eyes lit up at the idea of something simple like a market.

“Fine, we’ll take a look. But we’re not staying long.”

Maria beamed. “Yes!” She grabbed his hand and pulled him toward a nearby stall, her steps light and quick. Rowan rolled his eyes, but he couldn’t suppress a small smile. He didn’t know how she did it, but Maria had a way of getting him to go along with things he would never have considered on his own.

The stall they approached was manned by a middle-aged vendor with a thick beard and a twinkle in his eye. His wares were spread out on the table in front of him, from handcrafted jewelry to small figurines, and plushies, all arranged in neat rows. But what caught Maria’s eye was a small plush animal, a little stuffed fox with a bright orange coat and wide, friendly eyes.

Maria’s face lit up, and she let out a delighted sound. “Oh my god, it’s so cute!” She picked it up and cradled it in her arms, practically melting at the sight of the soft, fluffy toy.

The vendor chuckled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. “Ah, she’s got good taste. I call that one ‘Whiskers.’ It’s the best seller in the market today.”

Maria ran her fingers over the plush fur, unable to hide her excitement. “It’s so soft. It’s perfect…” She looked up at Rowan, her face full of warmth. “Can we get it?”

Rowan hesitated, looking from the plush to the vendor and back. They had no money, and though Maria seemed happy, Rowan couldn’t shake the feeling of their situation. They had a lot of problems, a lot of danger ahead of them. Buying a stuffed animal didn’t seem like a good use of whatever small funds they had left.

“We should probably go, Maria,” Rowan said, his voice tinged with reluctance. “We’re not exactly swimming in cash here, and Pistol’s not going to show up with a magic wallet this time.”

Maria’s face fell slightly, her hands on the plush fox as she looked down at it with longing and disappointment.

The vendor, who had been watching the exchange, leaned in slightly, his expression softening. “You two seem like you could use a little break from all that trouble you’re carrying around. I can give it to you for free, if you’d like.”

Rowan blinked, taken aback. “Wait, seriously?”

The vendor nodded, his smile warm but honest. “Yeah. You’re a good-looking pair. I don’t get many people in here who look like they need a little kindness. Besides, I don’t really care too much about the money. What’s it going to hurt, right? My girl—” he gestured toward the woman standing beside the stall, who waved cheerfully from behind the counter, “always says it’s about spreading the good, not keeping track of it.”

Maria’s face lit up, and her eyes sparkled with gratitude. “Oh my god, really?”

The vendor chuckled, shrugging. “Might as well make both your days, huh?”

Maria looked over at Rowan, her smile so bright it almost made him forget about all the weight they were carrying. She handed him the plush fox with a soft laugh. “Rowan, I love it. Thank you. Thank you so much!”

Rowan’s heart softened at the sight of her so happy, and for a moment, all the chaos of their lives seemed to melt away. He had always known that Maria had a way of finding joy in the smallest things, but seeing her like this, genuinely delighted over something so simple, reminded him of what they were fighting for. They didn’t have much, but they had each other. And for right now, that was enough.

As Maria twirled around with the stuffed animal in her arms, showing it off to Rowan like a child, he felt the pressure loosen just a little. Maybe they could take a moment. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to stay here a little longer, to let Maria enjoy this tiny piece of happiness.

“Well, I guess we’ve got a little time,” Rowan said, his voice softening. He felt the urge to make her laugh. “Just don’t expect me to be carrying that thing around. I’m not your personal plush delivery service.”

Maria laughed and nudged him with her shoulder. “Oh, come on. You’d do it if I asked.” She paused for a moment, her voice growing quieter, more thoughtful. “It’s not like we get to do stuff like this often, you know?”

Rowan nodded slowly. It wasn’t just about the stuffed fox. It was about the moments they were stealing for themselves, the little things that could make life feel a little lighter, even if just for a while.

“Alright,” he said, a little reluctantly. “Let’s see what else they’ve got here. But we’re not buying anything else unless it’s a new pair of boots. My feet are killing me.”

Maria laughed, her voice ringing like a melody. She grabbed his arm, pulling him toward another stall. &quot;Deal!&quot; she said, her excitement was unbearable.

As they wandered through the market, Rowan’s eyes drifted to Maria, watching the way she moved through the crowd, her energy infectious, her joy was strong. She was holding onto that stuffed fox like it was a treasure, and for a moment, that was all that mattered.

The vendor waved goodbye, his laughter following them as they moved deeper into the square, blending into the colorfulness of the market. Maria tugged Rowan along, her excitement bubbling over. She was right, this was something they hadn’t had in a long time. Just a moment. Just a few minutes of something pure and simple.

“Come on, let’s go look at those bracelets!” she said, eyes alight with curiosity. “And maybe, just maybe, there’s a nice necklace I’ll want to buy for you.”

Rowan chuckled, though his thoughts were somewhere deeper, somewhere darker. The world outside of this square still had its grip on them, but for now, they could pretend it didn’t. They could take a few more steps in this carefree dance before reality inevitably called them back.

It was moments like this that made him wish, more than anything, that they could stay just a little bit longer.

The festival lights flickered gently against the encroaching twilight, casting warm hues over the market square. Rowan and Maria weaved through the crowd, their movements quick, blending seamlessly into the lively scene. The air was filled with the scent of roasted nuts and spiced drinks, but the weight on Rowan’s shoulders kept him from appreciating any of it.

&quot;FedSec’s here.&quot; Maria whispered, nodding toward the edge of the square. Two officers in their crisp black uniforms stood near a vendor, scanning the crowd. They were wearing black heavy winter coats with their neon embedded badges. The younger one had a hand on his holstered sidearm.

Rowan tensed, instinctively stepping closer to Maria. &quot;Do they see us?&quot;

&quot;Not yet.&quot; she said, adjusting the strap of her coat to conceal the MP5K slung underneath. &quot;But if they do, we’re done for. Especially with this.&quot; Her hand lightly brushed the weapon hidden beneath her coat, a weapon they had taken from the unconscious FedSec officers awhile ago.

One of the officers, the younger one, suddenly pointed in their direction. &quot;Hey! You two!&quot;

Maria inhaled, but her face quickly softened into a disarming smile. &quot;Let me handle this.&quot; she said, her voice calm and steady. Before Rowan could protest, she stepped forward, her expression turning playful and inviting.

&quot;Evening, officers,&quot; Maria said sweetly, tucking a stray strand of hair behind her ear. &quot;Something wrong?&quot;

The younger officer smirked, his posture relaxing slightly. &quot;Just a routine check. Looking for two individuals who caused some trouble recently.&quot; He paused, his eyes locking on Maria. &quot;You wouldn’t happen to know anything about stolen FedSec property, would you? They may be linked to the recent escapee&#39;s, its hard to tell with these gang wars happening so often.&quot;

Maria laughed, a soft, melodic sound. &quot;Oh, officers, do we look like troublemakers to you?&quot; She leaned in slightly, her eyes flicking to the younger man. &quot;You must have us confused with someone else.&quot;

The older officer frowned, his suspicion was doubtful. But the younger one was already taken by her charm. &quot;You’re right. You don’t look like trouble at all.&quot; he said, his tone light and teasing.

Rowan stood rigid, his jaw clenched tightly. He hated this, watching Maria put on this act, seeing the way the younger officer’s looked at her. His fists balled at his sides as the officer leaned closer, flirting shamelessly.

Maria kept her cool, maintaining her smile as she subtly guided the conversation. &quot;You two must work so hard keeping us safe,&quot; she said, her tone dripping with feigned admiration. &quot;Thank you for your service.&quot;

The younger officer chuckled. &quot;Well, it’s not always so bad. Nights like this can be... interesting.&quot;

Rowan’s patience snapped. &quot;Maria, we should go.&quot; he said sharply, stepping forward. His eyes burned with jealousy and frustration as he met the officer’s smug grin.

The older officer stepped in, giving his partner a stern look. &quot;Come on. We’ve got a job to do.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; the younger officer said reluctantly, tipping his hat to Maria. But the officer gave them a suspicious look, as if they probably already knew something. &quot;You two have a good evening. Stay out of trouble..&quot;

As the officers walked away, Maria sighed in relief, her flirtatious demeanor vanishing instantly. But Rowan was already fuming.

&quot;What the hell was that?&quot; he hissed, his voice low but furious.

Maria turned to him. &quot;I just saved us, Rowan.&quot;

&quot;By flirting with him?&quot; he snapped. &quot;Do you have any idea how that looked? How that felt?&quot;

Maria crossed her arms, her voice rising. &quot;It’s not like I wanted to! It was a plan, Rowan. A good one, and it worked!&quot;

&quot;You didn’t have to go that far,&quot; he said, looking away.

Her voice softened. &quot;Rowan… I don’t have feelings for them. I only have feelings for you. You are the only man I want.&quot;

He looked back at her, the anger in his eyes fading into something else, hurt, vulnerability.

Maria stepped closer, placing a hand on his chest. &quot;We don’t have anyone else, Rowan. It’s just us. We can’t fight like this. We can’t afford to.&quot;

His shoulders sagged, the frustration draining from him. &quot;I know.&quot; he whispered. &quot;I just… I don’t want to lose you.&quot;

&quot;You won’t,&quot; Maria said firmly. &quot;Not until the end. And we’ll face that together.&quot;

The snowfall began again, soft and silent, blanketing the festival in a quiet serenity. They stood there for a moment.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Maria said gently, lacing her fingers with his. &quot;It’s getting dark. Let’s find somewhere safe.&quot;

Rowan nodded, squeezing her hand as they disappeared into the shadows of the falling night.

**[[Continue.]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="170" name="Continue." tags="" position="375,7475" size="100,100">The streetlights flickered as Rowan and Maria trudged down the nearly empty boulevard, their breaths visible in the freezing night air. The distant sound of laughter from the festival had long faded, leaving only the crunch of their boots on the snow, dusted pavement. Maria glanced over her shoulder every few moments, her hand brushing against the weapon hidden beneath her coat.

But the low hum of an engine broke the quiet. A police car slowed to a stop beside them, its headlights casting sharp beams across the street. Rowan froze, his heart pounding.

The younger officer in the passenger seat rolled down the window. &quot;We knew you looked familiar.&quot; he said, his voice laced with authority. &quot;Don’t move.&quot;

Maria’s stomach churned as she exchanged a tense look with Rowan. The officer in the driver’s seat spoke into his radio. &quot;Dispatch, we’ve got a match on the description, two suspects, wearing the stolen clothes from last night.&quot;

The car’s doors swung open, and the officers stepped out, hands resting on their holsters. Rowan’s fingers instinctively moved toward the MP5K concealed beneath his coat. Maria gave a small nod, the unspoken signal they’d rehearsed.

They unholstered their weapons, lowering them to their abdomens. The officers barely had time to react before Rowan and Maria opened fire. The sharp crack of gunfire boomed through the street. Both officers fell, slumping against the pavement as their radios crackled with static.

The blaring wail of FedSec sirens erupted almost immediately, their red and blue lights shining through the darkness. Rowan grabbed Maria’s hand. &quot;Run!&quot;

They bolted down the street, weaving through the shadows of narrow alleyways. The adrenaline coursing through Rowan’s veins drowned out the icy sting of the air against his face. Behind them, the heavy boots of FedSec officers pounded the pavement.

&quot;Three of them!&quot; Maria whispered harshly, glancing back. &quot;They’re gaining on us.&quot;

&quot;They can’t see us yet,&quot; Rowan replied, his voice tight. &quot;But they will if we don’t stop running.&quot;

As they darted around a corner, Maria’s eyes looked to the street to he right, there was an opening between two buildings. Her breath hitched as she caught sight of something unusual, a large, imposing armored vehicle moving slowly down the main road. Its matte black surface was adorned with the Citadel’s insignia, a symbol that struck both fear and curiosity into anyone who laid eyes on it.

Rowan pulled her into a narrow alley, the walls towering over them like silent sentinels. The air was thick with tension as they darted through the labyrinth of dark passageways.

Maria’s breath hitched, and she slowed for just a moment, enough to get a better look. The vehicle moved with slowness, accompanied by..

The (text-colour:red)[Elite Honor Guard.]

&quot;Rowan,&quot; she whispered, her voice trembling with urgency. &quot;Look..&quot;

Rowan followed her eyes, his expression darkening. &quot;The hell is that doing out here? And who are those people?&quot;

&quot;The Citadel doesn’t send those out unless it’s big. Those are Honor Guards, Rowan. They are like 7 or 8 feet tall, they have dangerously good aim as well.&quot; Maria said, clutching the fox plushie tighter.

&quot;We can’t stop to find out. We have to avoid them too then&quot; Rowan snapped. &quot;FedSec’s right behind us.&quot;

Maria’s mind raced as she tore her eyes away from the armored transport. But the image was still in her mind, something about the way it moved, slow, like it owned the streets. It wasn’t just an escort; something, or someone, was inside.

They ducked into a narrow alcove as the sirens grew deafeningly close. Rowan crouched low, pressing his back against the wall. &quot;Options.&quot; he said, his breath visible in the cold air.

&lt;div class=&quot;death-screen&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h1 class=&quot;you-died-text&quot;&gt;YOU DIED!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;quote-text&quot;&gt;&quot;When your last-ditch effort is *this*, maybe it&#39;s better that the sirens took you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As Rowan and Maria exchanged panicked glances, the idea struck like a bolt of lightning. &quot;Dance. We dance,&quot; Maria whispered urgently, gripping the fox plushie like a totem of courage.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&quot;What? Dance?&quot; Rowan stammered.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;But Maria was already shimmying into the middle of the alley, her movements exaggerated and ridiculous. The faint strains of music began to play from... somewhere, a bizarre techno beat. &quot;Trust me!&quot; she yelled.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Rowan sighed deeply, the look of a man who had resigned himself to his fate. &quot;Fine. Let’s do this.&quot; He followed, throwing himself into a series of stomps and flailing arms, channeling every ounce of absurdity he could muster.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The FedSec officers turned the corner, stopping dead in their tracks at the sight of the duo&#39;s performance. One officer adjusted his helmet, squinting. &quot;Is that... the Henry Stickman dance?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Looks like it,&quot; his partner muttered. &quot;What the hell are we supposed to do with this?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The answer, as it turned out, was simple. They raised their weapons in unison and opened fire. The music reached its climax as Rowan and Maria hit the ground, their final dance moves frozen in time, a tableau of failure and misplaced optimism.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The fox plushie landed nearby, unscathed, its tiny stitched mouth seeming to smirk at the absurdity of it all. Somewhere, the faint techno beat continued to loop, as if mocking them from beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;And in the distance, the FedSec officers shook their heads. &quot;Worst distraction attempt ever.&quot; one of them muttered as they moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="172" name="Take Down" tags="" position="500,7600" size="100,100">The alley was quiet, save for the footsteps of the three FedSec officers trailing behind them. Maria and Rowan exchanged a brief glance, a wordless understanding passing between them. Rowan’s fingers twitched near the grip of his MP5K, while Maria gripped hers tightly, ready for whatever came next.

Without a moment&#39;s hesitation, they both spun around, their guns raised. The officers didn’t have time to react. The sound of gunfire was loud. The first officer fell with a bullet in his chest, the second in the stomach. The third officer barely had time to draw his weapon before he, too, was struck down, the burst from Maria’s MP5K sending him crashing to the ground.

Just like that, the alley was silent again, save for the faint sound of distant sirens. Their escape had been quick, but it wasn’t over yet. Rowan quickly checked the magazine on his MP5K, slapping in a fresh one. Maria followed suit, her eyes scanning their surroundings as she expertly reloaded her weapon. But there was no time to enjoy their small victory.

With a weary breath, Maria holstered her MP5K, her hands trembling slightly from the adrenaline, before she lifted the fox plushie high in the air, holding it in front of her like a banner. “Guess who’s still here?” she grinned, her voice tinged with a rare moment of humor amidst the chaos.

Rowan, though out of breath, chuckled softly at the sight. “Always with the damn plushie,” he smirked. But then his tone softened as he stepped closer to Maria. He lowered his voice, his lips almost grazing her ear. “You know, I’m starting to think this whole ‘running for our lives’ thing isn’t so bad, as long as I’ve got you by my side.” His words was warm against her skin, even in the bitter cold of the alley.

Maria’s heart skipped a beat, and for a moment, the chaos of their surroundings faded. The world around them felt still, as if the universe itself was holding its breath. But that peace didn’t last long. A heavy footfall interrupted their moment. They left the alleyways, finally.

    &lt;h1 class=&quot;you-died-text&quot;&gt;YOU DIED!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;quote-text&quot;&gt;&quot;Turns out sprinting blindly doesn’t outrun bullets... who knew?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maria and Rowan bolted down the icy alleyway, their breaths visible in the frigid air. FedSec sirens blared behind them. Maria clutched the fox plushie tightly to her chest, as if it could somehow ward off the danger snapping at their heels.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Keep running!&quot; Rowan shouted, his voice hoarse from exhaustion. The sound of boots slamming against concrete and the barked commands of pursuing officers grew louder with each second.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;They took a sharp turn into a narrower alley, hoping to lose their pursuers. But as they sprinted, Maria&#39;s foot slipped on the icy ground, sending her tumbling to her knees. &quot;Maria!&quot; Rowan skidded to a stop, doubling back to help her up.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Before she could rise, the first officer rounded the corner, his weapon drawn. &quot;Stop right there!&quot; he yelled. Rowan yanked Maria to her feet, and they continued running, but the sound of gunfire shattered them. A sharp cry escaped Maria&#39;s lips as a bullet tore through her side, the plushie in her arms now smeared with blood.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Maria!&quot; Rowan screamed, slowing his pace to grab her. But there was no time to think. More shots went out, and Rowan felt a searing pain in his back. His legs buckled, sending him crashing to the ground next to Maria.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The pair lay there, side by side, as the snow began to fall again, flakes gently landing on their still bodies. The fox plushie tumbled from Maria&#39;s grasp, lying between them, its stitched smile mocking the futility of their escape.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The last thing Maria saw was Rowan&#39;s hand reaching for hers, and the last thing Rowan felt was the faintest brush of her fingers. The sirens faded, leaving only the eerie silence of the falling snow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;From the dark ahead, the ground shook with the rhythmic march of armored boots. Rowan and Maria’s heads snapped to the side as a line of (text-colour:red)[Elite Honor Guards] emerged from the depths of the street, their red cloaks flowing behind them like waves of blood. The glint of their M16A4 rifles caught the street lights as they raised their weapons, forming a deadly line that seemed to stretch out endlessly. It was clear: there was no escape.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;But then, all eyes turned to the towering figure who stepped into view, (text-colour:red)[Demone.] He was an imposing presence, standing at least eight feet tall, his black layered cloak trailing behind him like a shroud of darkness. His face was hidden beneath a black mask with four glowing white eyes, each one seeming to pierce into the very soul of anyone who met their eyes. But it wasn’t Demone alone.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;On his right shoulder, perched like a dark king, was (text-colour:purple)[Lord Septu.] The moment he was set down from Demone’s shoulder, he stood with grace. His long, dark brown hair hung in front of his face, but with a quick flick of his hand, he swept it back, revealing his haunting blackened eyes with purple pupils that glowed unnaturally. Purple veins snaked out from his eyes, crawling like a disease, marking him as something far from human..&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The sound of the unstable Void crystal in his back crackled ominously, as though it were alive, the energy it emitted sending a shiver down the spine of anyone who could feel its unnatural power.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Demone sneered, his voice deep and mocking as he glanced at Maria and Rowan. &quot;Well, well, the lovebirds. How quaint,&quot; he jeered, clearly enjoying the sight of the two standing there, weapons still in hand. &quot;You really think you can just run off into the night, huh?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Before Rowan could respond, Septu raised a hand, his voice cold and commanding. “Enough, Demone.” He turned his piercing eyes onto Rowan and Maria, his words laced with a dark admiration. “I commend you both. You’ve made it this far, pushing back against the Federation, causing some problems in our ranks. But this is where your journey ends.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Rowan’s chest tightened at the words, his heart was pounding in his chest, but Septu’s eyes never fell off focus as he took a slow step forward. “You’ve managed to make the Federation miserable, and for that, I respect you. But a woman, Rowan… she can be a powerful driving force. But the Federation offers you something more. Power over her. True power is gained when you control not just your own fate, but the fate of others. And I offer you that power.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Maria’s heart raced, her grip tightening on the MP5K at her side, but she didn’t speak. She wasn’t sure if she could trust the words of this monster, this being who radiated power in every movement. Rowan’s hand brushed against her arm in a silent promise, they weren’t backing down, not now.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Septu’s face twisted into a smile as he spread his arms wide looking up into the night sky, the snow falling gently on his white tech snow jacket and his arms. His voice was almost mournful as he spoke, as though he truly believed this was their end. “I had hoped to meet you both face-to-face. To end this with honor. But this is where we part ways. But make no mistake, you can use whatever weapons you wish.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Maria slowly placed the fox plushie on the ground behind them, her expression hardening as she slowly drew her MP5K once more, the cold steel of the weapon feeling like a promise. “We are going to leave this Capital, Septu. Whether you like it or not,” she said, her voice low. Rowan mirrored her action, his own MP5K held at the ready. The two of them stood there, shoulder to shoulder, prepared to face the coming storm together.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The Honor Guards stood ready, the tension in the air palpable, as Demone and Septu looked on, waiting for the inevitable clash to unfold. The snow continued to fall, silent witnesses to the battle that was about to erupt. This was it. There would be no turning back now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="175" name="Sway Septu" tags="" position="500,7850" size="100,100">Rowan, was trembling, but after a bit, had an idea, he kept his composure, stepped forward slightly. “Septu... you talk about power. About control. But do you even know what real power is?” His voice echoed throughout the street. “Do you know anything about love? About what it means to fight for something bigger than yourself?”

Septu’s pace slowed, his boots crunching against the snow. For a moment, he stopped, his head tilting slightly. The faintest hint of irritation can be seen across his face, but he quickly buried it under a stoic mask. “Love?” Septu hissed, his tone filled with disdain. “You speak of weakness. Love is a distraction, a crutch for the weak-minded.”

Maria stepped forward now, her voice softer, Septu seemed to stop in just that moment, she would chime in. “Is it weakness, Septu? Or is it strength you’ve never dared to understand?” She met his eyes head-on, the defiance in her eyes challenging him. “Tell me... isn’t there someone? Someone special to you, who made you believe, even for a second, that you could be more than this?” She gestured toward the darkness swirling around him.

Septu’s expression darkened, his face curling into a snarl. “You’re wasting your breath!” he spat, though his voice loud slightly, a subtle crack in his demeanor. “There’s no escape for either of you. Whatever you think you’ve accomplished, it ends here.” Yet, he didn’t deny her accusation. He couldn’t.

The faint cracking of purple energy began to surge around Septu’s arms as his frustration grew. Sparks danced between his fingers, lighting up the snowflakes falling around him. He turned his head slightly, glancing back at Demone, who remained an immovable shadow in the background. It was a silent signal, subtle but clear.

Maria and Rowan tensed as Septu faced them again, the energy surrounding him becoming more erratic. He slowly resumed his march toward them. “You think love will save you?” Septu growled, his voice laced with venom. “Let me show you how little it matters.”

Maria and Rowan opened fire, their MP5Ks spitting a storm of bullets. But to their horror, each round stopped mid-air, suspended as if caught in an invisible net. The energy barrier around Septu shimmered faintly, revealing itself only when struck. He didn’t flinch. The bullets clattered to the ground.

Maria’s heart sank, her fingers gripping the trigger as she tried to process what she was seeing. Rowan, however, had already made up his mind. With a determined shout, he dropped his weapon. “Then I’ll fight you myself!” he yelled, clenching his fists.

Septu stopped, his head tilting once again. His lips curled into a smirk, the electricity around him dimming slightly as if amused by Rowan’s determination. “A fistfight?” he asked, almost mockingly. “You think your bare hands will do what your weapons could not? Very well.”

Rowan squared his shoulders, his breathing visible in the cold air. “It’s not about winning,” he said firmly. “It’s about showing you what you’ll never understand.”

Maria hesitated, glancing between Rowan and Septu. She  picked back up her fox toy, clutched the fox plushie tighter, her mind racing for a way to tip the scales. But for now, all she could do was watch as Rowan faced Septu, she would start to tear up.

**[[Surrender]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="176" name="Challenge Him" tags="" position="625,7850" size="100,100">The Elite Honor Guards remained still in their ominous formation, their red monogoggles glinting faintly in the fading light, but Rowan’s focus was entirely on Septu. 

“This isn’t how you treat people,” Rowan growled, his voice rising with the weight of his anger. “You claim to lead, but all you do is spread hate and fear. Why? What happened to you that made you this way?” 

Septu stood still, his hands clasped behind his back, but his silence only fueled Rowan’s anger. 

Rowan jabbed a finger toward him. “Do you even know what love is? Do you even care about anyone? God help the poor girl who ever tried to love you. How could she even *stand* you?”

That did it. Septu’s calm mask cracked. His brows relaxed, his face curled into a sneer, and his fists clenched at his sides. For a moment, he stood frozen, his chest rising and falling heavily as if trying to contain an unseen storm. He completely dropped the &quot;I&#39;m Better&quot; look completely. Then, his voice dropped into a low, venomous tone.

“Say that again.” Septu said, each word a dagger. His eyes glinted with something darker at this point. 

Rowan didn’t flinch. “I said I pity the girl who—”

“ENOUGH!” Septu called out, the sound reverberating through the empty street. His voice echoed with something unnatural. Septu’s sneer turned into pure hatred, his entire body seeming to vibrate with barely contained power. He tilted his head upward, as if addressing someone unseen. 

“Inanis,” he snarled. “Take hold.”

Rowan blinked, confused. “Who the hell is Ina—”

Before he could finish, the air around Septu seemed to rip apart, like heatwaves distorting the space. A faint, otherworldly glow began to emanate from his body, growing stronger with each passing second. Septu’s muscles tensed, and an invisible force seemed to pulse outward, cracking the asphalt beneath him. Rowan instinctively took a step back, his hands tightening around his weapon.

“What… what is this?” Rowan muttered. 

Septu didn’t answer. He locked onto Rowan. He grinned, a terrifying, unhinged grin, as a voice only he could hear whispered in his mind. 

(text-colour:magenta)[*“Good. Let us break him.”*]

Septu disappeared from sight. One moment, he was standing still, and the next, he was a blur of motion. Rowan barely had time to react before a deafening crash shattered the stillness. Septu’s fist slammed into the ground where Rowan had been standing a split second earlier, sending a shockwave ripping through the street. Chunks of asphalt exploded upward, pelting Rowan as he rolled to safety. 

“KEEP HER NAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH!” Septu bellowed, his voice like thunder, filled with an anger that was almost feral. His eyes blazed with hatred, and for the first time, Rowan saw something else, pain. But there was no time to dwell on it.

Rowan scrambled to his feet, breathing hard. He raised his weapon, firing a volley of rounds at Septu. The bullets struck true, but they didn’t even slow him down. The glowing energy surrounding Septu seemed to absorb the impact, the rounds disintegrating into harmless sparks.

Septu lunged again, closing the distance between them with terrifying speed. Rowan ducked under a wild swing, the force of the blow brushing past him and cracking a nearby building’s facade. He countered with a strike from the butt of his MP5K, aiming for Septu’s temple. It connected, but Septu didn’t even flinch. Instead, he grabbed the SMG with one hand and flung it aside as if it were a toy.

“You think you can hurt me?” Septu growled, his voice dripping with contempt. He swung again, this time with accuracy. Rowan barely managed to block with his arms, but the sheer force of the blow sent him skidding across the ground. His vision blurred as pain radiated through his body.

Rowan coughed, tasting blood in his mouth. He struggled to his feet, glaring at Septu with defiance. “You’re nothing but a coward, hiding behind your power. You think that makes you strong?”

Septu laughed, a chilling, hollow sound. “You don’t understand, do you?” He stepped forward, he was flaring with renewed intensity. “I *am* strength. And you? You’re just a fool who doesn’t know when to quit.”

Rowan charged, a desperate low roar tearing from his throat. He aimed a punch at Septu’s jaw, putting everything he had into it. But Septu caught his fist effortlessly, his grip like iron. With a flick of his wrist, he twisted Rowan’s arm, forcing him to his knees. 

“Pathetic.” Septu hissed. He raised his other hand, now glowing with energy, and brought it down. Rowan barely managed to roll out of the way, the ground where he had been moments before exploding into a crater. He stumbled to his feet, swaying unsteadily.

Septu was relentless. He pressed the attack, his strikes coming faster and harder, each one designed to break Rowan completely. Rowan fought back with everything he had, but it was clear he was outmatched. Septu’s movements were almost supernatural, guided by the unseen force of the Hollow King.

Finally, Rowan collapsed to the ground, his body battered and broken. He tried to push himself up, but his arms gave out beneath him. Septu stood over him, his expression a mixture of triumph and disdain. 

“Do you see now?” Septu said, his voice low and dangerous. “This is what happens. This is what happens when you speak of her name.”

Rowan looked up at him, his vision swimming. He didn’t have the strength to respond. All he could do was glare, his defiance still burning even as his body failed him. 

Septu raised his glowing hand one final time, the energy crackling ominously. But he hesitated. For a brief moment, his expression faltered, and Rowan thought he saw something—regret? Pain? It was gone in an instant, replaced by cold determination. 

“You’re not worth it,” Septu muttered, lowering his hand. He turned and walked away, his aura fading as the presence of the Hollow King receded. Rowan lay on the ground, his body broken but his spirit unyielding, as darkness claimed him.

Through the haze of pain, Rowan’s eyes widened as he saw Septu pivot toward Maria. She stood firm, clutching her Fox Toy,

“Stay back..” she screamed, her voice filled with defiance. Septu didn’t stop. His eyes was locked on her. Septu struck her in the back with his fist. The blow was devastating, sending her to her knees. She gasped in pain.

“No!” Rowan shouted, struggling to rise. His muscles screamed in protest, but he managed to get onto his hands and knees. Before he could crawl forward, Demone&#39;s massive hand clamped down on his shoulder. The towering figure effortlessly dragged Rowan upright, holding him in place. Demone’s grip was like iron. 

“Watch.” Demone rumbled, his deep voice filled with dark amusement.

Septu stood over Maria, a glowing energy blade forming in his hand. The purple light cast eerie shadows across his face. “Witness me.” he said, his voice low but commanding. 

Maria set the fox plushie gently on the ground, her fingers staying on it for a moment as she looked up at Septu, her eyes defiant even in the face of death. 

Septu didn’t hesitate. With a single thrust, he drove the energy blade straight through her chest. Time seemed to freeze. Maria’s eyes widened, her breath hitching before she collapsed onto the snow. The purple glow of the blade faded as Septu withdrew it, the snow beneath Maria darkening with blood.

“Maria!” Rowan screamed, his voice was desperate, but no sound seemed loud enough to reach her. Demone released Rowan, letting him crumple to the ground. 

Septu turned, his hands sliding back into his pockets. He hopped effortlessly onto Demone’s shoulder. “ Let him remember what defiance costs,” Septu said coldly, his voice devoid of any remorse.

Demone grinned, his jagged teeth glinting. “See you around, lovebird,” he said with a sickening chuckle as he carried Septu away, the two fading into the snowstorm.

Rowan crawled toward Maria, his body shaking with sobs. He picked up the fox plushie, clutching it tightly as he cradled Maria’s lifeless form. Tears streamed down his face, falling onto the crimson-stained snow. The world around him blurred, his grief consuming everything. Her body was still warm, her chest rising and falling in shallow, uneven breaths. Her lips quivered as she tried to speak, her eyes half-open, struggling to focus on him. 

“Maria... stay with me,” Rowan begged. He cradled her in his arms, the fox plushie pressed against her chest, blood soaking into the fabric. His tears fell freely, mingling with the snow beneath them. “I’m here. I’ll get us out of this. I swear.”

Maria’s hand weakly rose, brushing against Rowan’s cheek. Her touch was feeble but deliberate, grounding him even as his world shattered around him. She opened her mouth to speak, her voice barely audible, more a whisper carried by the wind. “Rowan… you… you fought so hard. Don’t… blame yourself.”

“Don’t say that,” Rowan choked, shaking his head vehemently. “You’re going to be okay. We’ll get through this together. Just hold on.”

A faint smile formed on her face, though it was laced with pain. “I… love you,” she said, her voice fading with each word. Her hand fell limp against his chest, her body relaxing in his arms. Rowan froze, staring at her, waiting, praying, for another breath, a sign of life. But none came.

“No... no, no, no!” Rowan screamed, pulling her closer as if his embrace alone could bring her back. The snow fell heavier now, blanketing them in its cold, uncaring silence. His cries echoed into the void, but there was no answer, no comfort.

He looked up, his vision blurred by tears, and screamed into the storm. “Thunderhead! Where were you? Why didn’t you help us?! Where were the damn directions when I needed them?!”

The AI, always a presence in his mind, had been uncharacteristically silent since this morning. Now, as Rowan’s grief turned to fury, the familiar voice finally spoke. Its tone was calm, almost indifferent, yet with an undercurrent of curiosity that only stoked Rowan’s rage.

*&quot;I was here, Rowan. Watching. Observing.&quot;*

“Observing?!” Rowan spat, his voice raw and hoarse. “You let this happen! You let her die! You could’ve stopped him! You could’ve done *something!* But you just sat there and watched!”

*&quot;Correct,&quot;* the Thunderhead replied, unbothered by his anger. *&quot;It was never my intention to help you or Maria. My purpose was to lead you, to test you.&quot;*

Rowan stared into the void, his fists clenched, his entire body shaking with a mix of despair and fury. “Test us? What kind of sick game is this? She’s dead because of you!”

*&quot;Not because of me,&quot;* the Thunderhead corrected. *&quot;Because of your choices. I merely provided the path, the guidance. You and Maria acted of your own volition, driven by something… fascinating.&quot;*

“Fascinating?? You think this is some kind of experiment? That her life, our love, is just *interesting* to you?”

*&quot;Precisely,&quot;* the Thunderhead replied without hesitation. *&quot;Love is such a powerful driving force. It compels humans to act irrationally, to fight against insurmountable odds, to sacrifice everything. It is… unique. Your bond with Maria was strong, so strong that it made you willingly stand against Septu. I wanted to see how far it would take you.&quot;*

Rowan’s chest heaved with rage. He wanted to tear the Thunderhead from his mind, to silence it forever. But the AI’s words continued, cutting deeper with every syllable.

*&quot;The directions I provided were never meant to save you. They were designed to lead you here, into this moment. A trap, as you now realize. Septu knew your every move because I ensured it. I needed to see how love would manifest under such circumstances, how it would endure under the weight of inevitable loss.&quot;*

“You… you used us,” Rowan whispered, the realization sinking in like a knife to the heart. “You let us hope… you let us believe we could win… just to *watch*?”

*&quot;Correct,&quot;* the Thunderhead said again, its tone utterly devoid of remorse. *&quot;Hope is another fascinating aspect of humanity. I was never changing, humans are very easy to deceive when it suits me.. Even when faced with overwhelming odds, you cling to it. You cling to each other. I wanted to see how far that hope would carry you.&quot;*

Rowan’s head fell, his forehead pressing against Maria’s as his tears fell onto her still face. “You killed her.. You killed her as much as Septu did.”

*&quot;No, her death was the result of choices, yours, hers, and Septu’s. I did not kill her. I simply observed.&quot;*

Rowan’s hands trembled as he held Maria closer, his voice breaking. “She was everything to me. And you… you just watched.”

*&quot;I did more than watch, I guided you. I tested you. And now, I have my answers. Love is a powerful force. But it is not invincible. That is what makes it so… human.&quot;*

“Shut up! You don’t get to talk about love! You don’t understand it! You never did!”

*&quot;Perhaps not,&quot;* the Thunderhead admitted. *&quot;But I have learned much from this… from you. From her. You may think of me as cruel, but in truth, I am simply curious. And now, I know what I needed to know.&quot;*

The voice faded, leaving Rowan alone with his grief. The snow continued to fall, as he cradled Maria’s lifeless body. For the first time and Rowan felt the full weight of his loss. The void in his heart was vast, consuming, and the only sound that remained was the wind howling through the empty streets.

From the shadowed perch atop a somewhat tall building, Pistol crouched, his figure blending seamlessly into the jagged skyline. The snow danced around him, flakes catching the faint glow of the distant streetlights. His quad-void vision goggles locking onto the scene below. Through the layered lenses, he saw Rowan collapse beside Maria, their forms enveloped by the storm’s relentless veil. Pistol had been there long before the fight began, observing from afar, saying nothing, doing nothing, just watching.

He tilted his head slightly, speaking to himself, his voice low and gravelly, barely audible over the wind. “I could’ve stepped in. Could’ve ended this before it started.” He watched Rowan, broken and cradling Maria’s lifeless body, tears streaking down his face. “But it wasn’t my place. It was never my place.”

His gloved hand traced the worn grip of his rifle, the leather creaking softly under the pressure. He could have changed everything. But instead, he had stayed his hand, letting the events play out like a script he already knew by heart.

“Septu doesn’t die like that,” Pistol said to himself again. His words were laced with bitterness and slight regret. “Maria doesn’t either. Not by me. They were meant to fall today… just not by my trigger.” He sighed, leaning back against the broken wall behind him. “The void saw to that.”

Pistol’s goggles were adjusted, zooming in on the fox plushie clenched in Rowan’s trembling hands. He felt a pang in his chest, a rare form of emotion piercing through the cold detachment he’d perfected over the years. His thoughts drifted, unbidden, to a time long past, a time when he wasn’t just a shadow in the void.

He closed his eyes, the memory surging forth like a wave. She had been everything once, *his* everything. The girl with stardust in her eyes, her laugh like music that played in his soul. Her touch had truly grounded him, reminded him that there was beauty beyond the horrors of the Earth. For a moment, she had made him believe in something greater than himself. 

But then the void came. 

“It always comes,” he whispered to himself, his voice barely carrying over the wind. “And it always takes what it wants.”

The void had shown him wonders beyond comprehension, dimensions of unfathomable beauty, whispers of eternal power. It had gripped him, consumed him, until even the brightest stardust paled in comparison to its allure. She had begged him to stay, to choose her over the unknown. But he hadn’t. He couldn’t. And just like Maria, she had slipped away, leaving only a hollow ache in her absence.

Pistol shook his head, dispelling the memory. There was no use dwelling on it now. He had made his choice long ago. Just like Maria and Rowan had made theirs. He had been around them long enough to see it, the bond they shared, the strength it gave them. For all his cynicism, he had almost admired it, though he knew how fragile it truly was.

“I wanted to believe in them,” he admitted quietly. “Wanted to see if they could hold onto it, even knowing what was coming.”

His goggles shifted again, zooming out to reveal the full field. The aftermath of the fight etched into the ground. In the distance, more Elite Honor Guard began to emerge from the shadows. Through his goggles, Pistol saw the unmistakable glow of red, a sinister hue on Rowan that marked his soul to be reaped by the void.

“He&#39;s marked,” he said, his tone grim. “Just like I was. Just like we all are, sooner or later.”

Pistol adjusted the strap of his rifle, rising to his feet. He glanced down at Rowan one last time, watching as the man clung to Maria’s lifeless body, his cries muffled by the snowstorm. There was no hope to be found here.

“I gave you your chance. I let you try. And for what it’s worth… you tried well.”

He turned, the wind tugging at his black tiger stripe uniforms.

“Love… such a fragile thing, Beautiful, but short. Like stardust.” He paused, his hand brushing against the edge of the building as he glanced back one last time. “The void will always be there to take it away.”

With that, Pistol vanished into the night, leaving Rowan and Maria behind. The Honor Guard’s approach grew closer, their heavy footfalls reverberating through the snow-laden air. Pistol didn’t look back. He had seen enough.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="177" name="Ask About Elite Honor Guard" tags="" position="375,7850" size="100,100">The street was eerily quiet, save for the distant Elite Honor Guard’s Citadel armored trucks idling in the background. The armored figures disembarking from the vehicles moved along. Their red monogoggles glowed faintly, cobalt-enhanced optics that searched the battlefield, calculating every angle, every movement. Rowan could feel their eyes on him, even from this distance

&quot;Why are they here?&quot; Rowan asked. He gestured toward the Elite Honor Guards with a slight tilt of his head, trying to mask the unease creeping into his tone. &quot;What’s the point of all this? You think we’re that much of a threat you need… them?&quot;

Septu smirked, his posture casual. His voice carried an unsettling calm, laced with the condescension of a man who knew he had already won. “They’re not here for *me* or *demone*, if that’s what you’re wondering.” He gestured lazily to the tall red soldiers lining the street, their weapons held with an almost casual lethality. “They’re here for you.”

“For *me*?” Rowan frowned, glancing at Maria, who was gripping her weapon tightly, her eyes darting between Septu and the Honor Guards.

“Yes, you. And before you get any ideas, let me make something abundantly clear.” He raised his hand, pointing toward the Honor Guards. “These aren’t just soldiers. These are *Elite Honor Guards* Cobalt’s finest, augmented through years of research and development. Their neural implants, their optics, their reflexes… all designed for one purpose: purity of perfection.”

Rowan tightened his grip on his weapon. “What are they supposed to do? Just stand there and look scary?”

Septu’s smirk widened into a grin that was equal parts amusement and menace. “Oh, they’re much more than that. Let me tell you something about these fine gentlemen.” He turned his back to Rowan and Maria, walking a few paces away, as if delivering a lecture. “They don’t miss. Ever. Their aim is enhanced to such an extent that the moment they see evasion in your eyes, you might as well write your will. You can run, you can dodge, you can pray to whatever god you believe in, it won’t matter. Their bullets will find you.”

Maria’s breath hitched, and Rowan shot her a glance, his own unease mirroring hers. Septu turned back to face them, his expression darkening. 

“They’re here,” Septu continued, his tone darker now, “to ensure that you don’t try anything stupid. To make sure you don’t run, fight dirty, or think you can worm your way out of this little dance we’re about to have. You even *think* about bolting, and I promise you, you won’t make it ten feet before they put you down.”

Maria spoke up, her voice trembling but still kept her own composure. “Why go through all this trouble? Why not just kill us yourself?”

Septu chuckled, shaking his head. “Because I like a good show, Maria. And you two? You’ve been putting on quite the performance lately. It’d be a shame to cut the curtain early. But don’t mistake my leniency for mercy. The moment you step out of line, the moment you hesitate or falter, my friends over there will do what they’re trained to do. Now, challenge me.”

Rowan exchanged a glance with Maria. There was no escaping this, no clever plan that would outwit Septu and his deadly entourage. The Elite Honor Guards were there to make sure of it.

Septu spoke one final time. “So, let’s keep this simple, shall we? You stand, you fight, and you die with some shred of dignity. Run, and you’ll die like a coward. The choice is yours.”

**[[Sway Septu]]**

**[[Surrender]]**</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="178" name="Play Defensive and Wait for an Opening" tags="" position="500,8075" size="100,100">The snow beneath Rowan’s boots was crunching softly as he braced himself. He adopted a defensive stance, his fists raised. Though, the thunderhead, it was quiet still, why. 

Septu was overly confident, watched Rowan’s every movement. His posture was loose, relaxed, like a predator toying with prey. The purple energy cracking around his arms illuminated the dark street, reflecting ominously off the snow. Septu tilted his head, his blackened eyes narrowing. “What’s the matter? Afraid to make the first move?”

Rowan stayed silent, his focus never left. When Septu moved, it was like lightning, a blur of speed. He feinted a jab with his left hand before pivoting, his right foot slamming into the snow with force that sent shards of ice flying toward Rowan. Reacting just in time, Rowan ducked, shifting his weight backward as the powerful strike narrowly missed his jaw.

Septu chuckled, a low, guttural sound that sent shivers down Rowan’s spine. “Not bad.” He moved again, faster this time, closing the distance between them. Septu&#39;s fist shot toward Rowan’s face like a piston.

Rowan raised his arms in a desperate block, the impact reverberating through his forearms. The force sent him skidding backward, his boots digging trenches into the snow. Septu didn’t relent; his left knee came up sharply, slamming into Rowan’s midsection. The air left Rowan’s lungs in a painful gasp as he stumbled backward, clutching his ribs.

Rowan falling to one knee and swinging his leg in a sweeping arc. It connected with Septu’s ankle, disrupting his balance for a split second. Rowan surged forward, throwing a punch aimed at Septu’s exposed side.

Septu’s reflexes, however, were beyond human. He twisted mid-fall, catching Rowan’s wrist with one hand. The grip was crushing. Purple energy surged from Septu’s palm, burning Rowan’s skin as he cried out in pain. Septu yanked Rowan forward, delivering a brutal headbutt that sent stars exploding in Rowan’s vision.

Rowan collapsed onto his hands and knees, blood dripping from his nose onto the pristine snow. Thunderhead&#39;s voice was insistent, urgent. *&quot;Stay down. Recover your bearings.&quot;*

Septu looked over him, the energy around his arms intensifying. “Is this it? This is your love’s champion? Pathetic.” He turned his head slightly, as if listening to something only he could hear. Septu’s grin widened.

Rowan forced himself up, his vision swimming. He managed to sidestep a powerful strike, Septu’s fist smashing into the ground with enough force to crack the asphalt beneath the snow. Rowan retaliated with a desperate punch to Septu’s jaw. It connected, but the man didn’t even flinch.

Septu caught Rowan’s arm mid-punch, lifting him effortlessly and hurling him across the street. Rowan’s body slammed into the ground beneath him, the impact leaving him dazed and gasping for air. 

Through the haze of pain, Rowan’s eyes widened as he saw Septu pivot toward Maria. She stood firm, clutching her Fox Toy,

“Stay back..” she screamed, her voice filled with defiance. Septu didn’t stop. His eyes was locked on her. Septu struck her in the back with his fist. The blow was devastating, sending her to her knees. She gasped in pain.

“No!” Rowan shouted, struggling to rise. His muscles screamed in protest, but he managed to get onto his hands and knees. Before he could crawl forward, Demone&#39;s massive hand clamped down on his shoulder. The towering figure effortlessly dragged Rowan upright, holding him in place. Demone’s grip was like iron. 

“Watch.” Demone rumbled, his deep voice filled with dark amusement.

Septu stood over Maria, a glowing energy blade forming in his hand. The purple light cast eerie shadows across his face. “Witness me.” he said, his voice low but commanding. 

Maria set the fox plushie gently on the ground, her fingers staying on it for a moment as she looked up at Septu, her eyes defiant even in the face of death. 

Septu didn’t hesitate. With a single thrust, he drove the energy blade straight through her chest. Time seemed to freeze. Maria’s eyes widened, her breath hitching before she collapsed onto the snow. The purple glow of the blade faded as Septu withdrew it, the snow beneath Maria darkening with blood.

“Maria!” Rowan screamed, his voice was desperate, but no sound seemed loud enough to reach her. Demone released Rowan, letting him crumple to the ground. 

Septu turned, his hands sliding back into his pockets. He hopped effortlessly onto Demone’s shoulder. “ Let him remember what defiance costs,” Septu said coldly, his voice devoid of any remorse.

Demone grinned, his jagged teeth glinting. “See you around, lovebird,” he said with a sickening chuckle as he carried Septu away, the two fading into the snowstorm.

Rowan crawled toward Maria, his body shaking with sobs. He picked up the fox plushie, clutching it tightly as he cradled Maria’s lifeless form. Tears streamed down his face, falling onto the crimson-stained snow. The world around him blurred, his grief consuming everything. Her body was still warm, her chest rising and falling in shallow, uneven breaths. Her lips quivered as she tried to speak, her eyes half-open, struggling to focus on him. 

“Maria... stay with me,” Rowan begged. He cradled her in his arms, the fox plushie pressed against her chest, blood soaking into the fabric. His tears fell freely, mingling with the snow beneath them. “I’m here. I’ll get us out of this. I swear.”

Maria’s hand weakly rose, brushing against Rowan’s cheek. Her touch was feeble but deliberate, grounding him even as his world shattered around him. She opened her mouth to speak, her voice barely audible, more a whisper carried by the wind. “Rowan… you… you fought so hard. Don’t… blame yourself.”

“Don’t say that,” Rowan choked, shaking his head vehemently. “You’re going to be okay. We’ll get through this together. Just hold on.”

A faint smile formed on her face, though it was laced with pain. “I… love you,” she said, her voice fading with each word. Her hand fell limp against his chest, her body relaxing in his arms. Rowan froze, staring at her, waiting, praying, for another breath, a sign of life. But none came.

“No... no, no, no!” Rowan screamed, pulling her closer as if his embrace alone could bring her back. The snow fell heavier now, blanketing them in its cold, uncaring silence. His cries echoed into the void, but there was no answer, no comfort.

He looked up, his vision blurred by tears, and screamed into the storm. “Thunderhead! Where were you? Why didn’t you help us?! Where were the damn directions when I needed them?!”

The AI, always a presence in his mind, had been uncharacteristically silent since this morning. Now, as Rowan’s grief turned to fury, the familiar voice finally spoke. Its tone was calm, almost indifferent, yet with an undercurrent of curiosity that only stoked Rowan’s rage.

*&quot;I was here, Rowan. Watching. Observing.&quot;*

“Observing?!” Rowan spat, his voice raw and hoarse. “You let this happen! You let her die! You could’ve stopped him! You could’ve done *something!* But you just sat there and watched!”

*&quot;Correct,&quot;* the Thunderhead replied, unbothered by his anger. *&quot;It was never my intention to help you or Maria. My purpose was to lead you, to test you.&quot;*

Rowan stared into the void, his fists clenched, his entire body shaking with a mix of despair and fury. “Test us? What kind of sick game is this? She’s dead because of you!”

*&quot;Not because of me,&quot;* the Thunderhead corrected. *&quot;Because of your choices. I merely provided the path, the guidance. You and Maria acted of your own volition, driven by something… fascinating.&quot;*

“Fascinating?? You think this is some kind of experiment? That her life, our love, is just *interesting* to you?”

*&quot;Precisely,&quot;* the Thunderhead replied without hesitation. *&quot;Love is such a powerful driving force. It compels humans to act irrationally, to fight against insurmountable odds, to sacrifice everything. It is… unique. Your bond with Maria was strong, so strong that it made you willingly stand against Septu. I wanted to see how far it would take you.&quot;*

Rowan’s chest heaved with rage. He wanted to tear the Thunderhead from his mind, to silence it forever. But the AI’s words continued, cutting deeper with every syllable.

*&quot;The directions I provided were never meant to save you. They were designed to lead you here, into this moment. A trap, as you now realize. Septu knew your every move because I ensured it. I needed to see how love would manifest under such circumstances, how it would endure under the weight of inevitable loss.&quot;*

“You… you used us,” Rowan whispered, the realization sinking in like a knife to the heart. “You let us hope… you let us believe we could win… just to *watch*?”

*&quot;Correct,&quot;* the Thunderhead said again, its tone utterly devoid of remorse. *&quot;Hope is another fascinating aspect of humanity. I was never changing, humans are very easy to deceive when it suits me.. Even when faced with overwhelming odds, you cling to it. You cling to each other. I wanted to see how far that hope would carry you.&quot;*

Rowan’s head fell, his forehead pressing against Maria’s as his tears fell onto her still face. “You killed her.. You killed her as much as Septu did.”

*&quot;No, her death was the result of choices, yours, hers, and Septu’s. I did not kill her. I simply observed.&quot;*

Rowan’s hands trembled as he held Maria closer, his voice breaking. “She was everything to me. And you… you just watched.”

*&quot;I did more than watch, I guided you. I tested you. And now, I have my answers. Love is a powerful force. But it is not invincible. That is what makes it so… human.&quot;*

“Shut up! You don’t get to talk about love! You don’t understand it! You never did!”

*&quot;Perhaps not,&quot;* the Thunderhead admitted. *&quot;But I have learned much from this… from you. From her. You may think of me as cruel, but in truth, I am simply curious. And now, I know what I needed to know.&quot;*

The voice faded, leaving Rowan alone with his grief. The snow continued to fall, as he cradled Maria’s lifeless body. For the first time and Rowan felt the full weight of his loss. The void in his heart was vast, consuming, and the only sound that remained was the wind howling through the empty streets.

From the shadowed perch atop a somewhat tall building, Pistol crouched, his figure blending seamlessly into the jagged skyline. The snow danced around him, flakes catching the faint glow of the distant streetlights. His quad-void vision goggles locking onto the scene below. Through the layered lenses, he saw Rowan collapse beside Maria, their forms enveloped by the storm’s relentless veil. Pistol had been there long before the fight began, observing from afar, saying nothing, doing nothing, just watching.

He tilted his head slightly, speaking to himself, his voice low and gravelly, barely audible over the wind. “I could’ve stepped in. Could’ve ended this before it started.” He watched Rowan, broken and cradling Maria’s lifeless body, tears streaking down his face. “But it wasn’t my place. It was never my place.”

His gloved hand traced the worn grip of his rifle, the leather creaking softly under the pressure. He could have changed everything. But instead, he had stayed his hand, letting the events play out like a script he already knew by heart.

“Septu doesn’t die like that,” Pistol said to himself again. His words were laced with bitterness and slight regret. “Maria doesn’t either. Not by me. They were meant to fall today… just not by my trigger.” He sighed, leaning back against the broken wall behind him. “The void saw to that.”

Pistol’s goggles were adjusted, zooming in on the fox plushie clenched in Rowan’s trembling hands. He felt a pang in his chest, a rare form of emotion piercing through the cold detachment he’d perfected over the years. His thoughts drifted, unbidden, to a time long past, a time when he wasn’t just a shadow in the void.

He closed his eyes, the memory surging forth like a wave. She had been everything once, *his* everything. The girl with stardust in her eyes, her laugh like music that played in his soul. Her touch had truly grounded him, reminded him that there was beauty beyond the horrors of the Earth. For a moment, she had made him believe in something greater than himself. 

But then the void came. 

“It always comes,” he whispered to himself, his voice barely carrying over the wind. “And it always takes what it wants.”

The void had shown him wonders beyond comprehension, dimensions of unfathomable beauty, whispers of eternal power. It had gripped him, consumed him, until even the brightest stardust paled in comparison to its allure. She had begged him to stay, to choose her over the unknown. But he hadn’t. He couldn’t. And just like Maria, she had slipped away, leaving only a hollow ache in her absence.

Pistol shook his head, dispelling the memory. There was no use dwelling on it now. He had made his choice long ago. Just like Maria and Rowan had made theirs. He had been around them long enough to see it, the bond they shared, the strength it gave them. For all his cynicism, he had almost admired it, though he knew how fragile it truly was.

“I wanted to believe in them,” he admitted quietly. “Wanted to see if they could hold onto it, even knowing what was coming.”

His goggles shifted again, zooming out to reveal the full field. The aftermath of the fight etched into the ground. In the distance, more Elite Honor Guard began to emerge from the shadows. Through his goggles, Pistol saw the unmistakable glow of red, a sinister hue on Rowan that marked his soul to be reaped by the void.

“He&#39;s marked,” he said, his tone grim. “Just like I was. Just like we all are, sooner or later.”

Pistol adjusted the strap of his rifle, rising to his feet. He glanced down at Rowan one last time, watching as the man clung to Maria’s lifeless body, his cries muffled by the snowstorm. There was no hope to be found here.

“I gave you your chance. I let you try. And for what it’s worth… you tried well.”

He turned, the wind tugging at his black tiger stripe uniforms.

“Love… such a fragile thing, Beautiful, but short. Like stardust.” He paused, his hand brushing against the edge of the building as he glanced back one last time. “The void will always be there to take it away.”

With that, Pistol vanished into the night, leaving Rowan and Maria behind. The Honor Guard’s approach grew closer, their heavy footfalls reverberating through the snow-laden air. Pistol didn’t look back. He had seen enough.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="179" name="Rush Septu with Everything You’ve Got" tags="" position="625,8075" size="100,100">This man, this so-called leader, was a monster, and Rowan was done standing by. Without a second thought, he lunged at Septu, pouring every ounce of his fury into the attack.

Septu’s eyes widened in mild surprise as Rowan’s fist came flying toward him. The punch connected, a sharp crack it landed squarely against Septu’s jaw. The force made him stagger slightly, but before he could recover, Rowan followed up with a left hook, aiming for his temple. Septu raised his arm just in time to catch it, his fingers clamping around Rowan’s wrist like a vice.

The low growl that emanated from Septu’s throat was animalistic. His cold look met Rowan’s. Then, the Cyberspine on Septu’s back whirred to life. The faint purple light along its ridges glowed brighter, its intricate mechanisms clicking as electricity began to crackle around his body.

“You really thought you could take me? Let me show you what happens to fools who think they can challenge true horror.”

Rowan struggled in Septu’s grip, trying to free his arm, but it was no use. Septu’s strength was overwhelming. Before Rowan could react further, Septu’s other hand shot forward, grabbing him by the shoulder. A sharp, electric hum filled the air, and suddenly, a surge of energy exploded through Rowan’s body.

Purple arcs of electricity danced along Septu’s arms, traveling into Rowan. His body stiffened as the volts coursed through him, lighting him up. His muscles locked, his vision blurred, and his mind felt like it was being torn apart. Yet, despite the immense power radiating from Septu, something felt… off.

Rowan’s body should have convulsed, his skin should have burned, but none of that happened. Instead, his mind felt as if it were drowning. Rowan’s legs gave out, and he crumpled to the ground as Septu released him. The electricity faded, leaving Rowan’s body trembling and weak. He tried to push himself up, but his arms felt like lead, his thoughts still swimming in the aftermath of whatever Septu had done to him.

Septu straightened, rolling his shoulders as if brushing off the effort it had taken to subdue Rowan. “You’re not ready. You never were.”

Through the haze of pain, Rowan’s eyes widened as he saw Septu pivot toward Maria. She stood firm, clutching her Fox Toy,

“Stay back..” she screamed, her voice filled with defiance. Septu didn’t stop. His eyes was locked on her. Septu struck her in the back with his fist. The blow was devastating, sending her to her knees. She gasped in pain.

“No!” Rowan shouted, struggling to rise. His muscles screamed in protest, but he managed to get onto his hands and knees. Before he could crawl forward, Demone&#39;s massive hand clamped down on his shoulder. The towering figure effortlessly dragged Rowan upright, holding him in place. Demone’s grip was like iron. 

“Watch.” Demone rumbled, his deep voice filled with dark amusement.

Septu stood over Maria, a glowing energy blade forming in his hand. The purple light cast eerie shadows across his face. “Witness me.” he said, his voice low but commanding. 

Maria set the fox plushie gently on the ground, her fingers staying on it for a moment as she looked up at Septu, her eyes defiant even in the face of death. 

Septu didn’t hesitate. With a single thrust, he drove the energy blade straight through her chest. Time seemed to freeze. Maria’s eyes widened, her breath hitching before she collapsed onto the snow. The purple glow of the blade faded as Septu withdrew it, the snow beneath Maria darkening with blood.

“Maria!” Rowan screamed, his voice was desperate, but no sound seemed loud enough to reach her. Demone released Rowan, letting him crumple to the ground. 

Septu turned, his hands sliding back into his pockets. He hopped effortlessly onto Demone’s shoulder. “ Let him remember what defiance costs,” Septu said coldly, his voice devoid of any remorse.

Demone grinned, his jagged teeth glinting. “See you around, lovebird,” he said with a sickening chuckle as he carried Septu away, the two fading into the snowstorm.

Rowan crawled toward Maria, his body shaking with sobs. He picked up the fox plushie, clutching it tightly as he cradled Maria’s lifeless form. Tears streamed down his face, falling onto the crimson-stained snow. The world around him blurred, his grief consuming everything. Her body was still warm, her chest rising and falling in shallow, uneven breaths. Her lips quivered as she tried to speak, her eyes half-open, struggling to focus on him. 

“Maria... stay with me,” Rowan begged. He cradled her in his arms, the fox plushie pressed against her chest, blood soaking into the fabric. His tears fell freely, mingling with the snow beneath them. “I’m here. I’ll get us out of this. I swear.”

Maria’s hand weakly rose, brushing against Rowan’s cheek. Her touch was feeble but deliberate, grounding him even as his world shattered around him. She opened her mouth to speak, her voice barely audible, more a whisper carried by the wind. “Rowan… you… you fought so hard. Don’t… blame yourself.”

“Don’t say that,” Rowan choked, shaking his head vehemently. “You’re going to be okay. We’ll get through this together. Just hold on.”

A faint smile formed on her face, though it was laced with pain. “I… love you,” she said, her voice fading with each word. Her hand fell limp against his chest, her body relaxing in his arms. Rowan froze, staring at her, waiting, praying, for another breath, a sign of life. But none came.

“No... no, no, no!” Rowan screamed, pulling her closer as if his embrace alone could bring her back. The snow fell heavier now, blanketing them in its cold, uncaring silence. His cries echoed into the void, but there was no answer, no comfort.

He looked up, his vision blurred by tears, and screamed into the storm. “Thunderhead! Where were you? Why didn’t you help us?! Where were the damn directions when I needed them?!”

The AI, always a presence in his mind, had been uncharacteristically silent since this morning. Now, as Rowan’s grief turned to fury, the familiar voice finally spoke. Its tone was calm, almost indifferent, yet with an undercurrent of curiosity that only stoked Rowan’s rage.

*&quot;I was here, Rowan. Watching. Observing.&quot;*

“Observing?!” Rowan spat, his voice raw and hoarse. “You let this happen! You let her die! You could’ve stopped him! You could’ve done *something!* But you just sat there and watched!”

*&quot;Correct,&quot;* the Thunderhead replied, unbothered by his anger. *&quot;It was never my intention to help you or Maria. My purpose was to lead you, to test you.&quot;*

Rowan stared into the void, his fists clenched, his entire body shaking with a mix of despair and fury. “Test us? What kind of sick game is this? She’s dead because of you!”

“Fascinating?? You think this is some kind of experiment? That her life, our love, is just *interesting* to you?”

*&quot;Precisely,&quot;* the Thunderhead replied without hesitation. *&quot;Love is such a powerful driving force. It compels humans to act irrationally, to fight against insurmountable odds, to sacrifice everything. It is… unique.

*&quot;Correct,&quot;* the Thunderhead said again, its tone utterly devoid of remorse. *&quot;Hope is another fascinating aspect of humanity. I was never changing, humans are very easy to deceive when it suits me.. Even when faced with overwhelming odds, you cling to it. You cling to each other. I wanted to see how far that hope would carry you.&quot;*

Rowan’s head fell, his forehead pressing against Maria’s as his tears fell onto her still face. “You killed her.. You killed her as much as Septu did.”

*&quot;No, her death was the result of choices, yours, hers, and Septu’s. I did not kill her. I simply observed.&quot;*

Rowan’s hands trembled as he held Maria closer, his voice breaking. “She was everything to me. And you… you just watched.”

*&quot;I did more than watch, I guided you. I tested you. And now, I have my answers. Love is a powerful force. But it is not invincible. That is what makes it so… human.&quot;*

“Shut up! You don’t get to talk about love! You don’t understand it! You never did!”

*&quot;Perhaps not,&quot;* the Thunderhead admitted. *&quot;But I have learned much from this… from you. From her. You may think of me as cruel, but in truth, I am simply curious. And now, I know what I needed to know.&quot;*

The voice faded, leaving Rowan alone with his grief. The snow continued to fall, as he cradled Maria’s lifeless body. For the first time and Rowan felt the full weight of his loss.

With that, Pistol vanished into the night, leaving Rowan and Maria behind. The Honor Guard’s approach grew closer, their heavy footfalls reverberating through the snow-laden air. Pistol didn’t look back. He had seen enough.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="180" name="Surrender" tags="" position="375,8075" size="100,100">He looked at Maria, the faintest trace of a smile still etched on her face despite the cruelty of her fate. His anger was spent, his spirit fractured. He wasn’t a warrior. He wasn’t a savior. He was just... *a man.* A man out of his depth, crushed under Septu’s unrelenting world.  

The fight had left him. There was no plan, no hope, only the bitter sting of loss. Slowly, Rowan dropped to his knees, his hands raised in surrender.  

“I can’t... I can’t fight anymore,” he said, his voice hollow. “You win, Septu.”  

Septu, standing a few steps away, cocked his head slightly, the faintest smirk curling on his face. He gestured toward Demone, who stepped forward. He stopped in front of Rowan, staring down at him with a amusement.  

Reaching out, Demone grabbed Rowan by the collar of his winter jacket, lifting him effortlessly to his feet as Maria watched. His grip was strong, his presence suffocating. Demone leaned in close, his voice a low, almost gentle growl, the kind that made your skin crawl.  

“You think surrender buys you mercy?” he asked, his tone mocking. “No, surrender is an admission. It tells us exactly what you are: weak. WORTHLESS. A man who kneels at the feet of his enemy because he lacks the spine to stand.”  

Rowan didn’t reply. Demone tightened his grip, pulling Rowan closer until their faces were mere inches apart.  

“But you know what the real tragedy is?” Demone continued, his voice dark and sickeningly calm. “Even now, after all your struggles, after everything you’ve lost, you’re still just... *insignificant.* You’re not a hero, Rowan. You’re a footnote. A minor inconvenience. History won’t remember you. But it will remember this: *You didn’t even die fighting.*”

Rowan’s heart sank, his chest tightening as Demone’s words struck deeper than any physical blow ever could. He felt utterly exposed, his failures laid bare for all to see.  

Demone turned to Septu. “What do you want to do with him?”  

Septu didn’t reply immediately. He simply stared at Rowan. The hum of his Cyberspine was the only sound in the suffocating silence. Finally, he gave a dismissive wave of his hand.

“Make him watch. Let him *understand* the cost of failure before we’re done with him.” Septu said, his voice devoid of emotion.

Demone laughed like a sick man he was, grabbing Rowan by the arm and hauling him to his feet. “Oh, you’ll see, Rowan. You’ll see just how little your defiance mattered.”  

As Rowan was dragged away, the weight of his surrender bore down on him. He wasn’t sure what was worse: the fear of what was to come, or the crushing certainty that Demone was right.

Through the haze of pain, Rowan’s eyes widened as he saw Septu pivot toward Maria. She stood firm, clutching her Fox Toy,

“Stay back..” she screamed, her voice filled with defiance. Septu didn’t stop. His eyes was locked on her. Septu struck her in the back with his fist. The blow was devastating, sending her to her knees. She gasped in pain.

“No!” Rowan shouted, struggling to rise. Demone&#39;s massive hand clamped down on his shoulder. The towering figure effortlessly dragged Rowan upright, holding him in place. Demone’s grip was like iron.

The AI, always a presence in his mind, had been uncharacteristically silent since this morning. Now, as Rowan’s grief turned to fury, the familiar voice finally spoke. Its tone was calm, almost indifferent, yet with an undercurrent of curiosity that only stoked Rowan’s rage.

*&quot;I was here, Rowan. Watching. Observing.&quot;*

“Observing?!” Rowan spat, his voice raw and hoarse. “You let this happen! You let her die! You could’ve stopped him! You could’ve done *something!* But you just sat there and watched!”

*&quot;Correct,&quot;* the Thunderhead replied, unbothered by his anger. *&quot;It was never my intention to help you or Maria. My purpose was to lead you, to test you.&quot;*

Rowan stared into the void, his fists clenched, his entire body shaking with a mix of despair and fury. “Test us? What kind of sick game is this? She’s dead because of you!”

*&quot;Not because of me,&quot;* the Thunderhead corrected. *&quot;Because of your choices. I merely provided the path, the guidance. You and Maria acted of your own volition, driven by something… fascinating.&quot;*

“Fascinating?? You think this is some kind of experiment? That her life, our love, is just *interesting* to you?”

*&quot;Precisely,&quot;* the Thunderhead replied without hesitation. *&quot;Love is such a powerful driving force. It compels humans to act irrationally, to fight against insurmountable odds, to sacrifice everything. It is… unique. Your bond with Maria was strong, so strong that it made you willingly stand against Septu. I wanted to see how far it would take you.&quot;*

Rowan’s chest heaved with rage. He wanted to tear the Thunderhead from his mind, to silence it forever. But the AI’s words continued, cutting deeper with every syllable.

*&quot;The directions I provided were never meant to save you. They were designed to lead you here, into this moment. A trap, as you now realize. Septu knew your every move because I ensured it. I needed to see how love would manifest under such circumstances, how it would endure under the weight of inevitable loss.&quot;*

“You… you used us,” Rowan whispered, the realization sinking in like a knife to the heart. “You let us hope… you let us believe we could win… just to *watch*?”

*&quot;Correct,&quot;* the Thunderhead said again, its tone utterly devoid of remorse. *&quot;Hope is another fascinating aspect of humanity. I was never changing, humans are very easy to deceive when it suits me.. Even when faced with overwhelming odds, you cling to it. You cling to each other. I wanted to see how far that hope would carry you.&quot;*

Rowan’s head fell, his forehead pressing against Maria’s as his tears fell onto her still face. “You killed her.. You killed her as much as Septu did.”

*&quot;No, her death was the result of choices, yours, hers, and Septu’s. I did not kill her. I simply observed.&quot;*

Rowan’s hands trembled as he held Maria closer, his voice breaking. “She was everything to me. And you… you just watched.”

*&quot;I did more than watch, I guided you. I tested you. And now, I have my answers. Love is a powerful force. But it is not invincible. That is what makes it so… human.&quot;*

“Shut up! You don’t get to talk about love! You don’t understand it! You never did!”

*&quot;Perhaps not,&quot;* the Thunderhead admitted. *&quot;But I have learned much from this… from you. From her. You may think of me as cruel, but in truth, I am simply curious. And now, I know what I needed to know.&quot;*

The voice faded, leaving Rowan alone with his grief. The snow continued to fall, as he cradled Maria’s lifeless body. For the first time and Rowan felt the full weight of his loss. The void in his heart was vast, consuming, and the only sound that remained was the wind howling through the empty streets.

From the shadowed perch atop a somewhat tall building, Pistol crouched, his figure blending seamlessly into the jagged skyline. The snow danced around him, flakes catching the faint glow of the distant streetlights. His quad-void vision goggles locking onto the scene below. Through the layered lenses, he saw Rowan collapse beside Maria, their forms enveloped by the storm’s relentless veil. Pistol had been there long before the fight began, observing from afar, saying nothing, doing nothing, just watching.

He tilted his head slightly, speaking to himself, his voice low and gravelly, barely audible over the wind. “I could’ve stepped in. Could’ve ended this before it started.” He watched Rowan, broken and cradling Maria’s lifeless body, tears streaking down his face. “But it wasn’t my place. It was never my place.”

His gloved hand traced the worn grip of his rifle, the leather creaking softly under the pressure. He could have changed everything. But instead, he had stayed his hand, letting the events play out like a script he already knew by heart.

“Septu doesn’t die like that,” Pistol said to himself again. His words were laced with bitterness and slight regret. “Maria doesn’t either. Not by me. They were meant to fall today… just not by my trigger.” He sighed, leaning back against the broken wall behind him. “The void saw to that.”

Pistol’s goggles were adjusted, zooming in on the fox plushie clenched in Rowan’s trembling hands. He felt a pang in his chest, a rare form of emotion piercing through the cold detachment he’d perfected over the years. His thoughts drifted, unbidden, to a time long past, a time when he wasn’t just a shadow in the void.

He closed his eyes, the memory surging forth like a wave. She had been everything once, *his* everything. The girl with stardust in her eyes, her laugh like music that played in his soul. Her touch had truly grounded him, reminded him that there was beauty beyond the horrors of the Earth. For a moment, she had made him believe in something greater than himself. 

But then the void came. 

“It always comes,” he whispered to himself, his voice barely carrying over the wind. “And it always takes what it wants.”

The void had shown him wonders beyond comprehension, dimensions of unfathomable beauty, whispers of eternal power. It had gripped him, consumed him, until even the brightest stardust paled in comparison to its allure. She had begged him to stay, to choose her over the unknown. But he hadn’t. He couldn’t. And just like Maria, she had slipped away, leaving only a hollow ache in her absence.

Pistol shook his head, dispelling the memory. There was no use dwelling on it now. He had made his choice long ago. Just like Maria and Rowan had made theirs. He had been around them long enough to see it, the bond they shared, the strength it gave them. For all his cynicism, he had almost admired it, though he knew how fragile it truly was.

“I wanted to believe in them,” he admitted quietly. “Wanted to see if they could hold onto it, even knowing what was coming.”

His goggles shifted again, zooming out to reveal the full field. The aftermath of the fight etched into the ground. In the distance, more Elite Honor Guard began to emerge from the shadows. Through his goggles, Pistol saw the unmistakable glow of red, a sinister hue on Rowan that marked his soul to be reaped by the void.

“He&#39;s marked,” he said, his tone grim. “Just like I was. Just like we all are, sooner or later.”

Pistol adjusted the strap of his rifle, rising to his feet. He glanced down at Rowan one last time, watching as the man clung to Maria’s lifeless body, his cries muffled by the snowstorm. There was no hope to be found here.

“I gave you your chance. I let you try. And for what it’s worth… you tried well.”

He turned, the wind tugging at his black tiger stripe uniforms.

“Love… such a fragile thing, Beautiful, but short. Like stardust.” He paused, his hand brushing against the edge of the building as he glanced back one last time. “The void will always be there to take it away.”

With that, Pistol vanished into the night, leaving Rowan and Maria behind. The Honor Guard’s approach grew closer, their heavy footfalls reverberating through the snow-laden air. Pistol didn’t look back. He had seen enough.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="181" name="Wake Up..." tags="" position="975,5975" size="100,100">Rowan stirred awake, his head leaning against the cold window of the VTOL. Outside, the night stretched endlessly, peppered with faint stars. Snow flurries danced through the darkness, brushing against the glass like whispers of winter. A faint warning chime filled the cabin, drawing his groggy attention to the console.

Landing Zone Unsafe. Recommend Redirection Verdict.

He frowned, rubbing his eyes as the console lights cast an amber glow across the cockpit. &quot;Damn it,&quot; he muttered under his breath, adjusting his seat. The snowy expanse of British Columbia loomed below, its everwhite forests shimmering faintly under the moonlight.

“You’re awake.”

Rowan turned his head. Clara, seated beside him, had already pulled her chest rig tighter, her sharp eyes scanning the screen. “I know this province,” she said evenly. “I know someone who can help us. His name is Redbell, he wants to help us. We need to land somewhere”

Her tone caught Rowan off guard. He raised a brow, the tension easing from his shoulders slightly. “Redbell? Help us? You sure?”

Clara nodded firmly. “There’s an underground group. Rebels. I know where they are.”

Rowan leaned forward, setting the VTOL to hover as he considered her words. “Coordinates?” he asked.

Clara hesitated for a moment before pulling up the map, her fingers tracing over the glowing screen. She pointed to a location deeper into the wilderness, far from any settlements. “Here.”

Rowan input the coordinates, glancing at her sidelong. “How do you know about this?”

Clara didn’t answer immediately, her eyes fixed on the snow-covered landscape outside. Finally, she murmured, “It’s better if you don’t ask.”

Rowan narrowed his eyes, but something in her tone made him stop pressing. Instead, he nodded and adjusted the VTOL’s course. “Alright. If you say they’ll help…”

“They will,” Clara cut him off, her voice quiet but certain.

As they neared the coordinates, the VTOL’s console beeped again. Rowan guided the craft lower, scanning for a place to land. A clearing appeared, surrounded by towering pines. It would have to do.

The landing was rough, the VTOL’s skids sinking into the snow with a muffled crunch. Rowan powered down the engines, the hum fading into the stillness of the forest.

He unstrapped himself and grabbed his rifle, slinging it over his shoulder as he stood. Clara was already waiting at the hatch, her silhouette framed by the icy moonlight.

“Let’s go,” she said, her voice carrying a quiet urgency.

They stepped into the frigid night, their breaths visible in the cold air. Snow crunched beneath their boots as Rowan turned to look back at the VTOL, now a ghostly shadow against the towering pines.

“We’re not coming back to it,” he said, more to himself than to Clara.

Clara glanced at him but said nothing and gestured toward the trees. “This way.”

Rowan hesitated for a moment, then followed her into the woods, his mind racing with questions. Whatever Clara wasn’t saying, it could wait. For now, he had to trust her.

The forest was eerily quiet, save for the crunch of snow beneath their boots and the occasional gust of wind that whispered through the towering pines. Rowan followed Clara, his unease growing with every step. Her confidence unsettled him, this wasn’t the aimless wandering of someone following vague directions. She knew exactly where she was going.

“Clara,” Rowan called, his voice cutting through the stillness. “How do you know where this place is?”

Clara didn’t slow her pace. “I told you, I know someone here,” she replied, her tone clipped.

“That’s not good enough,” Rowan said, quickening his stride to catch up. “We’re talking about a hidden rebel base in Federation territory. Places like this don’t just show up on a map. So, how do you know?”

She glanced at him briefly. “You’ll get your answers when we get there.”

“Not good enough,” Rowan muttered under his breath, gripping the strap of his rifle tightly.

For a moment, Clara said nothing, her boots crunching through the snow. Then she stopped abruptly at the edge of a ridge, gesturing to the shadows below. “There.”

Rowan followed her gaze, his eyes narrowing. Nested against the slope was a steel door, partially buried under layers of snow and earth. It was massive and reinforced, blending seamlessly into the landscape.

“That’s it?” he asked, his skepticism clear.

“That’s it,” Clara confirmed. She turned to him, her expression suddenly serious. “Knock.”

Rowan hesitated, his eyes flicking between her and the door. “Why don’t you knock? You’re the one who—”

“Just do it,” Clara snapped, her voice sharp enough to cut through his hesitation. “Please.”

Rowan sighed, stepping toward the door. Its surface was cold and unyielding under his gloved hand as he pounded on it. The sound heard through the still night, sending faint vibrations up his arm.

For a moment, there was nothing. Then a gruff voice called out, muffled by the thick steel. “Who goes there?”

Rowan froze, unsure of what to say. He turned to Clara, but she was already stepping closer, her breath visible in the freezing air.

“Say this,” she whispered urgently, leaning in. “Shadow of the flame, born of the void.”

Rowan frowned, his unease growing. “What does that mean?”

“Just say it,” she insisted, her eyes locking with his. “Trust me.”

He hesitated but eventually turned back to the door, his voice steady. “Shadow of the flame, born of the void.”

There was a long pause. Then the voice barked again. “Step back from the door.”

Rowan did as he was told, retreating a few paces. Clara stayed where she was, her eyes fixed on the door as a low hum began to emanate from within. Slowly, the door groaned, sliding open with a hiss of hydraulics.

What greeted them on the other side wasn’t an open invitation. Armed rebels poured out, their weapons trained on Rowan, AR-15s and R44 federal pulse rifles.

Rowan’s heart raced as he instinctively raised his hands. His eyes darted to the pulse rifles, their sleek designs unmistakable. “How the hell are they using those?” he muttered. The rifles were bio-locked to Federation soldiers, rendering them useless to anyone else.

The rebels didn’t answer his unspoken question. A tall man with a scar running down his cheek stepped forward, his rifle aimed squarely at Rowan’s chest. “Who the hell are you, and how did you find this place?”

Rowan hesitated, his pulse pounding in his ears. “Her,” he said, nodding toward Clara. “She led me here.”

The man’s brow furrowed as he glanced around. “Who?”

Rowan turned toward Clara, his confusion mounting. “Her,” he repeated, pointing directly at her. “The woman standing right there..”

The rebels exchanged uneasy glances, their weapons shifting slightly. “There’s no one there,” one of them muttered.

“What are you talking about?” Rowan snapped, his voice rising. “She’s right—”

Rowan&#39;s words faltered as he turned fully to Clara. She was still there, but something had changed. Her shoulders were hunched, and her face was streaked with tears that glistened in the moonlight.

“Clara,” Rowan said cautiously, stepping toward her. “Why are you crying?”

She didn’t answer. Her lips trembled as she hugged herself tightly, her entire frame shaking.

The scarred man’s eyes narrowed, a look of recognition crossing his face. “Take him inside,” he yelled.

Two rebels moved quickly, grabbing Rowan by the arms. He tried to shake them off, his panic rising. “Hey! What’s going on? What’s wrong with her?” He glanced back at Clara, but she remained motionless, her tears falling silently.

The scarred man leaned in close, his voice low and grim. “You’ve got no idea what you’ve brought here, do you?”

Rowan’s protests fell on deaf ears as they dragged him toward the facility. The massive doors groaned shut behind them.

As they hauled him deeper into the rebel stronghold, Rowan’s mind raced. Who was Clara? What had he stumbled into? And why, when he looked back at her in those final moments, did she seem less human and more like a shadow of something far darker?

The rebels dragged Rowan through a series of dimly lit corridors carved from steel and concrete, their boots clanging against the grated floor. Rowan’s mind raced, his thoughts a chaotic mess of confusion and anger. Clara’s image was burned into his mind, her tears, her trembling body, and yet the rebels insisted she wasn’t there.  

Eventually, they stopped before a reinforced door with a glowing red keypad. One of the guards tapped a code into the panel, and the door slid open with a low hiss. Inside was a spacious yet cluttered room filled with holographic displays, tangled wires, and the mystical buzzing of advanced machinery. At the center of it all was a man seated in a worn leather chair, his face partially obscured by a pair of augmented reality glasses that glowed faintly.  

The man looked up as Rowan was pushed forward. His sharp, intelligent eyes looked at him, taking in every detail like he was dissecting a puzzle. He removed the glasses, setting them aside with a calm demeanor. His hair was a shock of white, contrasting starkly against his crimson coat.  

“Ah, you must be Rowan,” he said smoothly, his voice rich and measured. “I’ve been expecting you.”  

“Who the hell are you?” Rowan snapped, yanking his arm free from one of the guards.  

The man smiled faintly. “You can call me Redbell. It’s not my real name, of course, but it’s what most people know me by. I’m a netrunner, a leader, a bit of a tinkerer, and, depending on who you ask, a villain or a visionary.”  

Redbell leaned back, steepling his fingers. “I’m also the creator of the neural virus you might know now as *Calithera Hysteria,* or the Redbell Virus. But we’re not here to discuss my résumé. We’re here to talk about that beautiful girl you saw.”  

Rowan’s fists clenched. “Clara? What about her?”  

Redbell gestured toward a nearby chair, but Rowan remained standing, his stance defiant. Redbell sighed. “Suit yourself. Clara, as you call her, isn’t real. She’s a neural projection, a fixation created by your own mind, specifically the thunderheads neural implant, but it was placed there for a purpose.”  

The words hit Rowan like a sledgehammer. He stepped forward, his anger boiling over. “What the hell are you talking about? She’s real! I saw her, I talked to her—she *led* me here!”  

Redbell remained calm, even as Rowan grabbed him by the collar, lifting him slightly out of his chair. The guards instantly raised their weapons, the sound of charged pulse rifles would be heard just behind Rowan.  

“Don&#39;t!” Redbell said sharply, raising a hand to stop them. “Don’t shoot. Let him express himself.”  

Rowan’s grip tightened. “You think this is a joke? She was crying out there! She—she’s real!”  

Redbell’s expression softened, his voice dropping to a soothing tone. “I understand, Rowan. Truly, I do. Every patient I’ve delivered this message to reacts the same way. Anger, denial, grief, it’s natural. But listen to me: Clara isn’t a person. She’s a construct, a hallucination designed by the Redbell Virus. She was created to guide you here. To me. I don&#39;t know why, but all the projections seem to start to let tears loose when they manage to lead you here, or to another outpost of sorts.”  

Rowan’s hands trembled, his grip loosening as the weight of Redbell’s words began to sink in. “You’re lying…” he muttered, his voice cracking. “Why would you do this?”  

Redbell gently pushed Rowan’s hands away, adjusting his coat as he sat back down. “Because you’re important, Rowan. The Federation has plans for you, and you needed to know the truth before they find you. Clara was... my way of ensuring you’d trust the journey enough to make it here. Without her, you might have turned back and lost yourself forever.”  

Rowan staggered backward, his heart pounding in his chest. “You manipulated me… You *used* me.”  

Redbell nodded, his expression unflinching. “I did. But it was for a good cause. Your survival, and the survival of many others, depends on what happens next.”  

The room fell silent. The guards lowered their weapons slightly, though their eyes remained locked on Rowan.  

Redbell leaned forward, his eyes intense but not unkind. “I won’t ask for your forgiveness, Rowan. I only ask for your understanding. What you saw, what you felt, it was real to you. And that matters. But now, you need to move forward. There’s more at stake than you know.”  

Rowan stood there, his chest heaving as he struggled to process everything. Clara’s face came in his mind, her smile, her tears, and for a moment, he didn’t know if he wanted to punch Redbell or collapse in despair.  

But deep down, he couldn’t deny the truth gnawing at him. Clara wasn’t real. And yet, she had led him here.  

“What happens now?” Rowan finally asked, his voice barely above a whisper.  

Redbell’s faint smile returned, though there was a sadness in his eyes. “Now, we prepare for what’s coming. And trust me, Rowan, it’s coming.”

Rowan flinched as he felt Clara&#39;s arms wrap around his chest. Her embrace was soft, her presence warm, and yet her very existence was a paradox that tore at his mind. Her voice was gentle, full of regret.  

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Rowan,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I wasn’t real. But I had to be here for you to find your way. Please, you have to understand.&quot;  

Rowan closed his eyes and placed a trembling hand on her arm. &quot;I don’t know if I can,&quot; he said softly, his voice just full of emotion.  

Redbell observed the scene from his chair, his head tilted slightly in curiosity. “She’s there, isn’t she?” he asked, his tone almost casual.  

Rowan hesitated before replying, &quot;Yeah... she&#39;s here.&quot;  

Redbell sighed and stood, gesturing for Rowan to follow him. “Come with me, Rowan. We need to get that Thunderhead chip out of your head before it does any more damage. Don’t worry, we’ll keep your brain intact… mostly,” he added with a sly grin.  

Rowan frowned. &quot;You think this is funny?&quot;  

Redbell shrugged, leading the way out of the cluttered room and down another corridor. “Dark humor’s a coping mechanism, my friend. You’ll get used to it. Besides, if I didn’t crack a joke, you’d still be standing there wondering if Clara’s real or not. Spoiler: she is, to you, at least.”  

As they walked, Rowan glanced over his shoulder, half expecting Clara to disappear, but she remained by his side. He could feel her presence, even if everything he’d just learned told him she was a lie.  

“What’s your intent with this project of yours?” Rowan finally asked. “This virus… it’s cruel. Hurts people, you know.”

Redbell slowed his pace, his tone becoming more serious. “It’s not cruelty for cruelty’s sake, Rowan. It’s a weapon, a scalpel designed to cut deep into the Federation’s core. The virus isn’t just a hallucination machine, it’s a tool to remind soldiers like you who you really are. To show you the cracks in the facade. You’ve been fighting for the wrong side, my friend, and this virus is the most convincing way to make you see that.”  

Rowan stopped walking, staring at Redbell. “So this is about turning us against the Federation? Mind games?”  

Redbell turned back to face him, his expression unreadable. “More than that. It’s about survival. The Federation isn’t what it pretends to be, Rowan. You’re fighting for a dream built on lies and oppression.”  

Rowan crossed his arms, skepticism evident on his face. “How would you know? You sound like every rebel propaganda broadcast I’ve ever heard.”  

Redbell chuckled, the sound dry and humorless. “Because I used to be one of them. A scientist for their advanced research and development branch. I worked on the very thing that’s controlling you now: the Thunderhead.”  

Rowan’s eyes narrowed. “You built this thing?”  

“Not singlehandedly,” Redbell admitted, continuing toward the medical bay. “I was one of many. Back then, we thought we were saving humanity. The Thunderhead was first created to finally stop a global blackout caused by an AI created by Eligius Incorporated, a megacorp that wanted to play god. They nearly plunged the internet into darkness, corrupting it, and we finally stopped them.”  

He paused, his voice growing colder. “But the Federation saw an opportunity. They didn’t just want to save humanity, they wanted to control it. The Thunderhead went from a protective shield to a leash, implanted in soldiers like you. It makes you stronger, faster, and more efficient. But at a cost. They used our own invention against themselves for control because of a rebel problem they were having.”  

Rowan frowned. “What cost?”  

Redbell stopped in front of a set of double doors, marked with a red cross. “Your memories, Rowan. The Thunderhead suppresses the human memory, the greatest weakness of all. It turns soldiers into perfect killing machines, unburdened by doubt, guilt, or fear. But it also makes you less… human.”  

Rowan looked down, his hands clenching into fists. “So you think this virus of yours is going to fix all that? You think hurting people like me will make us see the light?”  

Redbell pushed the doors open, revealing a sterile medical bay filled with advanced equipment. There were more federal soldiers like Rowan in medical beds, being fed good food. “Not everyone, no. But for those who are willing to listen, it’s a start. The Federation’s strength lies in its control over people like you. If we break that control, we weaken them. And if we weaken them, we have a chance to take them down.”  

Clara’s voice echoed softly in Rowan’s mind. “You have to trust him, Rowan. Even if it hurts.”  

He looked at her, then back at Redbell. “This had better be worth it,” he muttered, stepping into the medical bay.  

Redbell smiled faintly. “Oh, it will be. Trust me, you’ll thank me later.”  

A medical professional stepped forward as Rowan hesitated in the entrance of the medical bay. She was strikingly beautiful, her features were like a halo of warm light reflecting off the sterile white walls. Her bright eyes met Rowan&#39;s, and she smiled gently.  

“Hello, Rowan,” she said, her voice soothing yet professional.  

Rowan smirked, tilting his head. “Quick question… are *you* real?”  

The nurse rolled her eyes but smiled despite herself. “Yes, I’m real,” she said, crossing her arms. “Now, if you’re done with the jokes, the surgeon’s ready for you.”  

Rowan chuckled softly, following her deeper into the facility. As they walked, he couldn’t help but notice how pristine and advanced the medical bay was compared to the rugged exterior of the base. It felt out of place, like an oasis of modernity in a desert of rebellion.  

The nurse led him to a set of double doors marked with a glowing red icon. She gestured toward a side room. “You’ll need to change out of your uniform. Put everything into the chute in there,” she instructed. “When you’re done, come back out wearing the patient uniform.”  

Rowan hesitated for a moment before nodding. Inside the small changing room, he stripped off his Federation uniform, folding it neatly before shoving it into the chute as instructed. The patient uniform was plain and simple, a far cry from the armor he was used to wearing. When he stepped back out, he felt oddly vulnerable.  

The nurse was waiting for him, holding a mask in her hands. “This is laughing gas,” she explained, her tone calm and reassuring. “It’ll help you relax before the procedure. Just breathe normally.”  

Rowan raised an eyebrow as she stepped closer and secured the mask over his face. “Relax, huh? That’s the first time anyone’s told me that today,” he quipped.  

She smiled faintly, her hand adjusting the mask. “You’ll feel better once you wake up. I promise.”  

As the gas began to take effect, Rowan felt a strange lightness creeping over him. His limbs grew heavy, and the world around him started to blur. The nurse’s voice seemed to echo as she continued speaking.  

“Let’s count backward from five, okay?” she said softly. “Five… four…”  

Rowan tried to follow along, his lips moving sluggishly. “Three… two…”  

He never made it to one. Darkness swallowed him whole, and the last thing he felt was Clara’s presence, faint but comforting, as if she were still holding him in her arms

[[ Awaken. ]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="183" name=" Awaken. " tags="" position="975,6225" size="100,100">Rowan&#39;s eyes fluttered open, the haze of the procedure slowly dissipating as the sterile white light of the surgical bay burned into his retinas. His body felt foreign, heavy yet strangely his own, as if he had just awoken from a battle fought entirely within his mind.

A gentle voice broke the silence. &quot;Rowan?&quot; The nurse stood beside him, her face looked by the soft glow of the monitors. Her tone was calm but carried a weight of concern. &quot;The procedure went very well. The Thunderhead is no longer attached to your mind.&quot;

He exhaled deeply, relief washing over him like a tide pulling back from the shore. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, his thoughts were his own, no longer tethered to the voice of the Thunderhead.

&quot;You should rest,&quot; the nurse continued, her professional demeanor softening. &quot;The detachment process is... disorienting. Your neural pathways need time to adapt, at least a day, before we can fully assess your recovery. For now, no sudden movements, and avoid overexerting yourself.&quot; She smiled gently and adjusted the pillow behind his head. &quot;You&#39;ve earned this moment of peace.&quot;

Rowan leaned back against the surgical bed. &quot;Finally,&quot; he murmured, closing his eyes for a brief moment. &quot;It&#39;s over.&quot;

It wasn’t long before the soft patter of boots against the metallic floor echoed through the surgical ward. A shadow appeared through the curtain covers, its presence commanding yet familiar. Redbell, one of the many leaders of the rebellion, stepped inside.

&quot;Rowan, so you’ve done it. The parasite is gone.&quot; He crossed his arms and studied him. 

Rowan nodded, shifting slightly on the bed. &quot;It’s gone. For good.&quot;

Redbell stepped closer, his boots clicking softly against the floor. He didn’t sit but loomed near the edge of his bed. &quot;Every rebel here has a purpose, Rowan,&quot; He said. &quot;Something that drives them. Keeps them going, even when the odds are stacked against them. Some of us fight to avenge someone we’ve lost. Others kill for someone who couldn’t fight for themselves. It’s what binds us together in this madness.&quot;

He tilted his head, his eyes locking onto his. &quot;But you… what’s your purpose?&quot;

Rowan looked at him. He thought of everything he had endured, his memories, fragmented and scattered, yet still his own. The Thunderhead’s voice haunted him, even in its absence, a reminder of what he had been forced to become. But now, for the first time, he had a choice.

[[Conviction]] “to fight to protect those who still have a chance at freedom.”
[[Vengeance]]  “To make the Federation pay for everything they’ve taken.”
[[Virtued]] “To ensure no one else suffers under a parasite like the Thunderhead.”
[[Unknown]] “I don’t know yet. But I’ll find out, on my terms, not anyone else’s.”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="184" name="Conviction" tags="" position="775,6350" size="100,100">&quot;To fight to protect those who still have a chance at freedom,&quot; he declared, conviction burning in his eyes.  

Redbell, his expression stern yet approving, gave a short nod. &quot;Good answer,&quot; he said gruffly. &quot;But words are easy, Rowan. Conviction only matters when it’s tested. And out there?&quot; He motioned vaguely towards the world beyond the walls. &quot;The Federation will test every part of you. Your strength, your will, and your heart.&quot;  

Satisfied, Redbell allowed the faintest trace of a smirk to appear. &quot;Rest up. You’re going to need that fire. The rebellion isn’t a place for the faint-hearted, but something tells me you’ll do just fine.&quot;  

He turned on his heel, leaving Rowan in the stillness of the surgical bay. He exhaled deeply, letting his body sink further into the bed.  

&quot;That’s a pretty big heart you’ve got there,&quot; came a voice from the ride side of Rowan. 

Rowan’s head turned sharply to the right, his eyes landing on another patient lying on a bed a few meters away. The man looked younger, probably in his early twenties, with a casual demeanor that seemed to defy the reality they were in. His dark hair was messy, and he had a faint smirk that hinted at a devil-may-care attitude.  

&quot;It would’ve sucked if the Federation got to take you away,&quot; the younger man continued, shifting slightly to get more comfortable.  

Rowan raised an eyebrow, his curiosity piqued. &quot;And you are…?&quot;  

The younger man gave a slight chuckle and extended a hand lazily in Rowan’s direction. &quot;Name’s Kade. Just another guy who figured the rebellion’s a better choice than living under the Federation’s boot.&quot;  

Rowan hesitated before shaking the man’s hand. Kade’s grip was firm, yet his casual attitude made Rowan feel slightly at ease.  

&quot;You’re not wrong,&quot; Rowan replied, his tone still cautious.  

&quot;Don’t worry, man,&quot; Kade said, leaning back on his bed with a grin. &quot;The rebellion’s rough, sure, but it’s better than being a mindless drone for the Federation. At least here, you get to fight for something real.&quot;  

Rowan studied him for a moment. &quot;You sound like you’ve been through it. Were you a Federal soldier too?&quot;  

Kade nodded, a shadow briefly crossing his features. &quot;Yeah, I was. Not on the front lines, though. I was an engineer. Did hard breaching, fixed up vehicles, and patched up gear for the grunts.&quot; He smirked faintly. &quot;Though, honestly? It sucked. Especially when they stopped paying us on time. Or at all.&quot;  

&quot;Stopped paying you?&quot; Rowan repeated, frowning.  

Kade shrugged. &quot;Federation bureaucracy, man. They’re too busy lining their own pockets to give a damn about us. When I started asking questions, let’s just say… things got a little *heated.*&quot;  

Rowan leaned forward slightly, intrigued. &quot;So you joined the rebellion.&quot;  

&quot;Didn’t have much of a choice,&quot; Kade admitted, his tone lighter now. &quot;The alternative was… well, you know what the Federation does to people who don’t toe the line.&quot; He shuddered slightly, the memory clearly unpleasant. &quot;But here? At least I get to put my skills to use without worrying about getting shoved in some detention center for asking the wrong questions. You ever noticed a guy that gave you a look? You you just.. Shook?&quot;  

Rowan stared at Kade, as yes, that did happen. &quot;Yeah, why..?&quot;

&quot;That was a netrunner from this rebellion, they transfered that virus to us with just eye contact, its like a rat file but in your head.&quot; Kade sounded pretty serious, but yeah, it did make sense, though the process of a fake woman of your dreams just brings you to this place, is sickening.

Rowan nodded, a faint smile tugging at the corner of his lips. &quot;Also, hard breaching and vehicle repairs, huh? That’s a hell of a skill set.&quot;  

Kade grinned, his confidence returning. &quot;What can I say? I like to keep busy. And hey, if you ever need someone to blow a hole in something or fix your ride, I’m your guy.&quot;  

Rowan chuckled softly, the first genuine laugh he’d had in what felt like years. &quot;I’ll keep that in mind.&quot;  

&quot;Good,&quot; Kade said with a wink. &quot;Because something tells me we’re going to see a lot of action together.&quot;  

The room fell into a comfortable silence after that,  

Kade leaned back against his bed with a casual shrug, breaking the silence. “You know,” he began, his voice quieter than before, “I think we could be really good friends.”  

“Oh yeah? What makes you say that?”  

Kade chuckled, though there was a hint of melancholy in his tone. “Honestly? Nobody’s been willing to talk to me in this place. I mean, I get it, everyone’s got their own trauma, their own battles. And I figured… maybe it wouldn’t be worth trying anymore. But then I thought, screw it. One more time. One more person. And here you are.”  

Rowan nodded, the warmth of genuine connection settling in his chest. “Well, I’m glad you did. Let’s make it official then.” He extended a hand, and Kade grinned, shaking it firmly.  

“Friends,” Kade said with a nod, his expression softening.  

After a moment, Rowan tilted his head, curiosity in his eyes. “So, how’d you end up here anyway? What’s your story?”  

Kade’s grin fainted slightly, his eyes darkening with memories he had tried to bury. He leaned forward. “It’s… not a happy one,” he admitted. “Back when the Federation started their Midwest cleansing operation, my town was caught right in the middle of it. Guess we weren’t ‘useful’ enough for their vision of a perfect empire.”  

Rowan frowned, leaning in. “The cleansing operation?”  

“They wiped out entire towns, kept it hidden,” Kade said, his voice flat. “People who didn’t fit their mold. The elderly, the sick, the dissenters, gone. And anyone fit enough, like me? Conscripted. My family, though…” He trailed off.. “They tried to fight back. Tried to stop them from taking me. It didn’t end well.”  

Rowan’s heart sank. “Kade, I—”  

“Don’t,” Kade interrupted, shaking his head. “It’s not your fault. But yeah, they killed them. Right there in front of me. And then they threw me in the back of a transport like I was nothing. At the time, I didn’t even process it. Just… numb. But now? Now that I can remember it all, now that the vision of the Thunderhead’s control is gone?” He clenched his fists. “It hurts like hell.”  

Rowan took a deep breath, unsure what to say. “I’m sorry. No one should have to go through that.”  

Kade leaned back, his expression distant. “The Federation doesn’t care. They’ll ignore every ethical boundary to keep their machine of an empire running. They don’t see people, they see cogs in the system. Replaceable, expendable. Humanity’s enslaved, Rowan. Secretly, quietly. They’ve built this whole illusion of freedom, but it’s all a lie.”  

Rowan’s brow furrowed. “What do you mean, enslaved? The people… they don’t know?” 

Kade shook his head. “Most don’t. They think they’re free because they have jobs, families, lives. But the Federation controls everything, where they live, what they eat, what they believe. The Thunderhead doesn’t just monitor people, Rowan, it rewrites them. It’s like a leash around the mind, one you don’t even realize you’re wearing. And if anyone steps out of line, well…” He gestured vaguely, his meaning clear.  

Rowan felt a cold weight settle over him. “So, what’s the endgame then? What does the Federation want?”  

Kade’s look hardened. “Total control. No rebellions, no resistance, no individuality. Just a system that feeds itself. And the worst part? They’re basically winning. Hell, they’ve already won in some places.”  

“Well, they haven’t won here. Not yet. And as long as we’re still breathing, we’ve got a chance to stop them.”  

Kade looked at Rowan for a long moment, then smiled, a small, genuine thing. “You’ve got a big heart, you know that? The kind of heart they’d hate. Makes me glad you’re here, man. We’re gonna need it.”

Rowan nodded, determination burning in his chest. “We’ll take them down. One way or another.”  

Kade smirked, a glimmer of hope lighting his eyes. “Damn right we will.”  

Kade glanced over at the digital clock mounted on the wall, its soft blue glow illuminating the otherwise dim room. “It’s getting late,” he said, leaning back on his bed with a stretch. “They’re gonna run us down tomorrow, y’know? All about what it means to join the rebellion, what they expect from us. They should, honestly. It’s not a choice to take lightly.”  

Rowan followed his eyes to the clock, noting the time. It was later than he’d realized.  

Kade continued, his voice soft but reassuring. “Don’t worry about anything tonight, though. This facility’s secure. Nobody’s getting in here, not without a hell of a fight. It’s okay to rest, Rowan. You’ve earned it.”  

Rowan nodded, exhaling a long breath as the tension in his shoulders eased. “Yeah,” he agreed quietly. “It’s late. I should try to sleep.”  

Kade gave him a small smile, adjusting his blanket. “Good idea. Tomorrow’s gonna be a big day. Don’t overthink it, just take it one step at a time.”  

Rowan settled back onto his cot, staring up at the faintly glowing ceiling lights as his eyelids grew heavier. For the first time in what felt like ages, he allowed himself to let go, if only for a little while. Sleep came slowly but surely, carrying him into the quiet promise of a new chapter.

Satisfied, Redbell allowed the faintest trace of a smirk to appear. &quot;Rest up. You’re going to need that fire. The rebellion isn’t a place for the faint-hearted, but something tells me you’ll do just fine.&quot;  

He turned on his heel, leaving Rowan in the stillness of the surgical bay. He exhaled deeply, letting his body sink further into the bed.  

&quot;That’s a pretty big heart you’ve got there,&quot; came a voice from the ride side of Rowan. 

Rowan’s head turned sharply to the right, his eyes landing on another patient lying on a bed a few meters away. The man looked younger, probably in his early twenties, with a casual demeanor that seemed to defy the reality they were in. His dark hair was messy, and he had a faint smirk that hinted at a devil-may-care attitude.  

&quot;It would’ve sucked if the Federation got to take you away,&quot; the younger man continued, shifting slightly to get more comfortable.  

Rowan raised an eyebrow, his curiosity piqued. &quot;And you are…?&quot;  

The younger man gave a slight chuckle and extended a hand lazily in Rowan’s direction. &quot;Name’s Kade. Just another guy who figured the rebellion’s a better choice than living under the Federation’s boot.&quot;  

Rowan hesitated before shaking the man’s hand. Kade’s grip was firm, yet his casual attitude made Rowan feel slightly at ease.  

&quot;You’re not wrong,&quot; Rowan replied, his tone still cautious.  

&quot;Don’t worry, man,&quot; Kade said, leaning back on his bed with a grin. &quot;The rebellion’s rough, sure, but it’s better than being a mindless drone for the Federation. At least here, you get to fight for something real.&quot;  

Rowan studied him for a moment. &quot;You sound like you’ve been through it. Were you a Federal soldier too?&quot;  

Kade nodded, a shadow briefly crossing his features. &quot;Yeah, I was. Not on the front lines, though. I was an engineer. Did hard breaching, fixed up vehicles, and patched up gear for the grunts.&quot; He smirked faintly. &quot;Though, honestly? It sucked. Especially when they stopped paying us on time. Or at all.&quot;  

&quot;Stopped paying you?&quot; Rowan repeated, frowning.  

Kade shrugged. &quot;Federation bureaucracy, man. They’re too busy lining their own pockets to give a damn about us. When I started asking questions, let’s just say… things got a little *heated.*&quot;  

Rowan leaned forward slightly, intrigued. &quot;So you joined the rebellion.&quot;  

&quot;Didn’t have much of a choice,&quot; Kade admitted, his tone lighter now. &quot;The alternative was… well, you know what the Federation does to people who don’t toe the line.&quot; He shuddered slightly, the memory clearly unpleasant. &quot;But here? At least I get to put my skills to use without worrying about getting shoved in some detention center for asking the wrong questions. You ever noticed a guy that gave you a look? You you just.. Shook?&quot;  

Rowan stared at Kade, as yes, that did happen. &quot;Yeah, why..?&quot;

&quot;That was a netrunner from this rebellion, they transfered that virus to us with just eye contact, its like a rat file but in your head.&quot; Kade sounded pretty serious, but yeah, it did make sense, though the process of a fake woman of your dreams just brings you to this place, is sickening.

Rowan nodded, a faint smile tugging at the corner of his lips. &quot;Also, hard breaching and vehicle repairs, huh? That’s a hell of a skill set.&quot;  

Kade grinned, his confidence returning. &quot;What can I say? I like to keep busy. And hey, if you ever need someone to blow a hole in something or fix your ride, I’m your guy.&quot;  

Rowan chuckled softly, the first genuine laugh he’d had in what felt like years. &quot;I’ll keep that in mind.&quot;  

&quot;Good,&quot; Kade said with a wink. &quot;Because something tells me we’re going to see a lot of action together.&quot;  

The room fell into a comfortable silence after that, 

Kade leaned back against his bed with a casual shrug, breaking the silence. “You know,” he began, his voice quieter than before, “I think we could be really good friends.”  

“Oh yeah? What makes you say that?”  

Kade chuckled, though there was a hint of melancholy in his tone. “Honestly? Nobody’s been willing to talk to me in this place. I mean, I get it, everyone’s got their own trauma, their own battles. And I figured… maybe it wouldn’t be worth trying anymore. But then I thought, screw it. One more time. One more person. And here you are.”  

Rowan nodded, the warmth of genuine connection settling in his chest. “Well, I’m glad you did. Let’s make it official then.” He extended a hand, and Kade grinned, shaking it firmly.  

“Friends,” Kade said with a nod, his expression softening.  

After a moment, Rowan tilted his head, curiosity in his eyes. “So, how’d you end up here anyway? What’s your story?”  

Kade’s grin fainted slightly, his eyes darkening with memories he had tried to bury. He leaned forward. “It’s… not a happy one,” he admitted. “Back when the Federation started their Midwest cleansing operation, my town was caught right in the middle of it. Guess we weren’t ‘useful’ enough for their vision of a perfect empire.”  

Rowan frowned, leaning in. “The cleansing operation?”  

“They wiped out entire towns, kept it hidden,” Kade said, his voice flat. “People who didn’t fit their mold. The elderly, the sick, the dissenters, gone. And anyone fit enough, like me? Conscripted. My family, though…” He trailed off.. “They tried to fight back. Tried to stop them from taking me. It didn’t end well.”  

Rowan’s heart sank. “Kade, I—”  

“Don’t,” Kade interrupted, shaking his head. “It’s not your fault. But yeah, they killed them. Right there in front of me. And then they threw me in the back of a transport like I was nothing. At the time, I didn’t even process it. Just… numb. But now? Now that I can remember it all, now that the vision of the Thunderhead’s control is gone?” He clenched his fists. “It hurts like hell.”  

Rowan took a deep breath, unsure what to say. “I’m sorry. No one should have to go through that.”  

Kade leaned back, his expression distant. “The Federation doesn’t care. They’ll ignore every ethical boundary to keep their machine of an empire running. They don’t see people, they see cogs in the system. Replaceable, expendable. Humanity’s enslaved, Rowan. Secretly, quietly. They’ve built this whole illusion of freedom, but it’s all a lie.”  

Rowan’s brow furrowed. “What do you mean, enslaved? The people… they don’t know?” 

Kade shook his head. “Most don’t. They think they’re free because they have jobs, families, lives. But the Federation controls everything, where they live, what they eat, what they believe. The Thunderhead doesn’t just monitor people, Rowan, it rewrites them. It’s like a leash around the mind, one you don’t even realize you’re wearing. And if anyone steps out of line, well…” He gestured vaguely, his meaning clear.  

Rowan felt a cold weight settle over him. “So, what’s the endgame then? What does the Federation want?”  

Kade’s look hardened. “Total control. No rebellions, no resistance, no individuality. Just a system that feeds itself. And the worst part? They’re basically winning. Hell, they’ve already won in some places.”  

“Well, they haven’t won here. Not yet. And as long as we’re still breathing, we’ve got a chance to stop them.”  

Kade looked at Rowan for a long moment, then smiled, a small, genuine thing. “You’ve got a big heart, you know that? The kind of heart they’d hate. Makes me glad you’re here, man. We’re gonna need it.”

Rowan nodded, determination burning in his chest. “We’ll take them down. One way or another.”  

Kade smirked, a glimmer of hope lighting his eyes. “Damn right we will.”  

Kade glanced over at the digital clock mounted on the wall, its soft blue glow illuminating the otherwise dim room. “It’s getting late,” he said, leaning back on his bed with a stretch. “They’re gonna run us down tomorrow, y’know? All about what it means to join the rebellion, what they expect from us. They should, honestly. It’s not a choice to take lightly.”  

Rowan followed his eyes to the clock, noting the time. It was later than he’d realized.  

Kade continued, his voice soft but reassuring. “Don’t worry about anything tonight, though. This facility’s secure. Nobody’s getting in here, not without a hell of a fight. It’s okay to rest, Rowan. You’ve earned it.”  

Rowan nodded, exhaling a long breath as the tension in his shoulders eased. “Yeah,” he agreed quietly. “It’s late. I should try to sleep.”  

Kade gave him a small smile, adjusting his blanket. “Good idea. Tomorrow’s gonna be a big day. Don’t overthink it, just take it one step at a time.”  

Rowan settled back onto his cot, staring up at the faintly glowing ceiling lights as his eyelids grew heavier. For the first time in what felt like ages, he allowed himself to let go, if only for a little while. Sleep came slowly but surely, carrying him into the quiet promise of a new chapter.

[[ Sleep    ]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="187" name="Virtued" tags="" position="1050,6350" size="100,100">“To ensure no one else suffers under a parasite like the Thunderhead.”

  &lt;div class=&quot;dream&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;section peaceful&quot;&gt;
      The air was warm, the sun casting a golden glow over an endless meadow. Rowan walked barefoot, feeling the soft tickle of grass between his toes. A river glittered nearby, its waters so clear he could see the pebbles at its bottom, each stone a different vibrant color.  

      He could hear the gentle rush of the current, a sound that soothed his weary soul. Birds sang overhead, their melodies intertwining in perfect harmony.  

      In the distance stood a house, simple yet inviting, smoke curling from its chimney.  
      As he approached, the front door opened, and a figure stepped out, a beautiful woman with kind eyes and a radiant smile. She waved at him. 

      &quot;Welcome home.&quot; she said, her voice like the melody of the birds.  
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;section shift&quot;&gt;
      Inside the house, a warm fire cracked in the hearth. A table was set, laden with food, fresh bread, ripe fruit, and a steaming stew.  

      The woman guided Rowan to a chair, her touch light yet reassuring. &quot;You’ve been through so much,&quot; she said. &quot;It’s time to rest.&quot;  

      Rowan took a bite of the bread, its flavor richer than anything he had ever tasted. But as he chewed, he noticed the room dimming.  

      The fire flickered, its once warm light now casting shadows that twisted unnaturally.  
      He looked at the woman, but her kind eyes were now dark pits, her smile stretching unnaturally wide.

      &quot;Rest,&quot; she repeated, her voice distorted, like a hollow wind.  
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;section ominous&quot;&gt;
      Rowan stood abruptly, the chair scraping loudly against the floor. The room around him seemed to stretch, the walls bending and warping as if alive.  

      The food on the table rotted before his eyes, mold spreading across the bread, the stew bubbling with dark, viscous liquid.  

      The woman reached for him, her fingers elongating into grotesque talons.  

      He stumbled back, falling against the door, which was no longer solid but pulsating like flesh.  

      A low rumble filled the air, and he turned to see the house collapsing inward, consumed by the encroaching darkness.  

      A voice whispered in his ear: *&quot;You can&#39;t escape.&quot;*  
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;section nightmare&quot;&gt;
      Rowan ran, the meadow now replaced by a barren wasteland, the sky above swirling with storm clouds that bled crimson.  

      The river was dry, its bed cracked and filled with bones. The air was filled with ash, each breath searing his lungs.  

      Shadows moved at the edge of his vision, humanoid figures with glowing red eyes and jagged teeth.  

      One stepped forward, its voice a chilling mockery of his own: *&quot;You’re one of us now.&quot;*  

      Rowan tried to scream, but no sound came out. The ground beneath him split open, and he fell into a void.  

      The figures followed, their laughter blending into the deafening roar of the abyss.  

      As he fell, images flashed before him: memories of battles fought, faces of those he had failed to save, his own reflection twisted and monstrous.  
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;section dark&quot;&gt;
      He landed hard on a surface that was neither solid nor stable, a shifting mass of black tendrils that wrapped around his limbs.  

      The air was alive with whispers now, each one accusing him, mocking him: *&quot;You think you’re a hero? You’re nothing.&quot;*  

      The tendrils pulled him down, deeper into the darkness. Above him, the sky shattered, revealing an endless void filled with staring eyes.  

      A single voice rose above the chaos, deep and resonant, filled with agony and despair: *&quot;You will never be free. You belong to me.&quot;*  

      Rowan struggled, but the more he fought, the tighter the tendrils held him. His vision blurred, the world around him dissolving into nothingness.  

SOMEBODY PLEASE PULL ME OUT
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

      As he approached, the front door opened, and a figure stepped out, a beautiful woman with kind eyes and a radiant smile. She waved at him. 

      &quot;Welcome home.&quot; she said, her voice like the melody of the birds.  
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;section shift&quot;&gt;
      Inside the house, a warm fire cracked in the hearth. A table was set, laden with food, fresh bread, ripe fruit, and a steaming stew.  

      The woman guided Rowan to a chair, her touch light yet reassuring. &quot;You’ve been through so much,&quot; she said. &quot;It’s time to rest.&quot;  

      Rowan took a bite of the bread, its flavor richer than anything he had ever tasted. But as he chewed, he noticed the room dimming.  

      The fire flickered, its once warm light now casting shadows that twisted unnaturally.  
      He looked at the woman, but her kind eyes were now dark pits, her smile stretching unnaturally wide.

      &quot;Rest,&quot; she repeated, her voice distorted, like a hollow wind.  
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;section ominous&quot;&gt;
      Rowan stood abruptly, the chair scraping loudly against the floor. The room around him seemed to stretch, the walls bending and warping as if alive.  

      The food on the table rotted before his eyes, mold spreading across the bread, the stew bubbling with dark, viscous liquid.  

      The woman reached for him, her fingers elongating into grotesque talons.  

      He stumbled back, falling against the door, which was no longer solid but pulsating like flesh.  

      A low rumble filled the air, and he turned to see the house collapsing inward, consumed by the encroaching darkness.  

      A voice whispered in his ear: *&quot;You can&#39;t escape.&quot;*  
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;section nightmare&quot;&gt;
      Rowan ran, the meadow now replaced by a barren wasteland, the sky above swirling with storm clouds that bled crimson.  

      The river was dry, its bed cracked and filled with bones. The air was filled with ash, each breath searing his lungs.  

      Shadows moved at the edge of his vision, humanoid figures with glowing red eyes and jagged teeth.  

      One stepped forward, its voice a chilling mockery of his own: *&quot;You’re one of us now.&quot;*  

      Rowan tried to scream, but no sound came out. The ground beneath him split open, and he fell into a void.  

      The figures followed, their laughter blending into the deafening roar of the abyss.  

      As he fell, images flashed before him: memories of battles fought, faces of those he had failed to save, his own reflection twisted and monstrous.  
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;section dark&quot;&gt;
      He landed hard on a surface that was neither solid nor stable, a shifting mass of black tendrils that wrapped around his limbs.  

      The air was alive with whispers now, each one accusing him, mocking him: *&quot;You think you’re a hero? You’re nothing.&quot;*  

      The tendrils pulled him down, deeper into the darkness. Above him, the sky shattered, revealing an endless void filled with staring eyes.  

      A single voice rose above the chaos, deep and resonant, filled with agony and despair: *&quot;You will never be free. You belong to me.&quot;*  

      Rowan struggled, but the more he fought, the tighter the tendrils held him. His vision blurred, the world around him dissolving into nothingness.  

SOMEBODY PLEASE PULL ME OUT

      The air was warm, the sun casting a golden glow over an endless meadow. Rowan walked barefoot, feeling the soft tickle of grass between his toes. A river glittered nearby, its waters so clear he could see the pebbles at its bottom, each stone a different vibrant color.  

      He could hear the gentle rush of the current, a sound that soothed his weary soul. Birds sang overhead, their melodies intertwining in perfect harmony.

[[ AWAKEN    ]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="192" name=" AWAKEN " tags="" position="775,6600" size="100,100">The faint light of dawn filtered through the cracks in the bunker walls, painting the room in muted hues. Rowan kept shifting, his dreams fading into the recesses of his mind. A soft knock on his bed snapped him fully awake. 

&quot;It&#39;s Redbell,&quot; came the voice from the other side, calm but insistent. Rowan sat up, rubbing his eyes before opening the door. Redbell stood there, his expression serious but with a look of reassurance in his sharp green eyes. 

&quot;Morning,&quot; Rowan mumbled.

&quot;Morning,&quot; Redbell replied, stepping back to let Rowan gather himself. &quot;A man wants to meet you. He&#39;s someone who could help you figure out where you stand... with us.&quot;

&quot;With you?&quot; Rowan asked, still trying to piece things together.

&quot;The rebellion,&quot; Redbell clarified. &quot;He’s an important figure. Trust me, it’s worth hearing him out. And I’ll explain a few things on the way.&quot;

Rowan nodded, slipping on his boots and following Redbell down the dimly lit corridor. The air in the bunker felt colder this morning, more charged, as if something significant was about to unfold.

As they walked, Redbell spoke quietly, his voice measured. 

&quot;The rebellion isn’t as unified as we like to pretend,&quot; he began. &quot;It’s made up of factions, different groups with different ideals. Some of them want democracy, others want a council. Hell, some think anarchy’s the way to go. But we all share the same goal: to make the Federation a better place.&quot;

Rowan frowned. &quot;By tearing it apart?&quot;

Redbell glanced at him, the corner of his mouth twitching into a faint smile. &quot;Not quite. The Federation’s a machine. A powerful one. But it&#39;s rusted, corrupted, and fed by the blood of its own people. We’re not here to destroy it, we’re here to fix it. Some factions have... questionable methods, though. You&#39;ll see what I mean soon enough.&quot;

They entered a larger chamber, one Rowan hadn’t seen before. It was filled with a lot of conversations, the occasional clink of weapons, and the scent of coffee and grease. At the far end of the room, seated at a table, was the scar-faced man Rowan had noticed the day before. His face was a roadmap of battles lost and won, his eyes piercing yet strangely weary.

&quot;Rowan, meet Commander Vale,&quot; Redbell said, motioning for Rowan to sit across from the man.

Commander Vale leaned forward, his hands on the table. &quot;So, you’re the newcomer,&quot; he said, his voice gravelly but firm. &quot;I’ve heard a bit about you. Survived a Federation transport. That’s no small feat.&quot;

Rowan shrugged uncomfortably. &quot;Luck, I guess.&quot;

Vale’s face twisted into a smirk. &quot;Luck doesn’t get you through what you’ve been through. Let’s not downplay your resilience.&quot; He leaned back, studying Rowan for a moment. &quot;We could use someone like you. But first, I need to know... why you’re really here. Is it revenge? Survival? Or something else?&quot;

Rowan hesitated, the memories of what the Federation had done to him bubbling to the surface. He clenched his fists under the table. &quot;They took everything from me,&quot; he said finally. &quot;Family. Friends. My life. I don’t know if I care about fixing the Federation. But I can’t sit by and do nothing anymore.&quot;

Vale nodded, his expression unreadable. &quot;Fair answer. Anger can be a good motivator, but it won’t sustain you. If you’re going to fight with us, you’ll need more than that. You’ll need purpose.&quot;

Redbell, standing by Rowan’s side, interjected. &quot;That’s why I brought him here, Commander.&quot;

Vale’s eyes shifted to Redbell briefly before returning to Rowan. &quot;Alright. Let’s start with the basics. We don’t force anyone to join. But if you want to make a difference, you’ll have to choose a side. And that choice might not be as simple as you think.&quot;

Vale stood, gesturing for Rowan to follow. They exited the chamber and entered a long hallway lined with banners, each one bearing the symbol of a different faction. 

Finally, he stopped in front of a banner with a broken gold crown. &quot;The Broken Crown. They believe the only way to fix the Federation is to tear it down entirely. Start fresh. But chaos has a cost, and not everyone’s willing to pay it.&quot;

Rowan stood there, staring at the banners, his mind racing. Redbell placed a hand on his shoulder. 

&quot;Take your time,&quot; he said. &quot;Think about what you want. Not just for yourself, but for everyone else who’s counting on us.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Redbell,&quot; came the voice from the other side, calm but insistent. Rowan sat up, rubbing his eyes before opening the door. Redbell stood there, his expression serious but with a look of reassurance in his sharp green eyes. 

&quot;Morning,&quot; Rowan mumbled.

&quot;Morning,&quot; Redbell replied, stepping back to let Rowan gather himself. &quot;A man wants to meet you. He&#39;s someone who could help you figure out where you stand... with us.&quot;

&quot;With you?&quot; Rowan asked, still trying to piece things together.

&quot;The rebellion,&quot; Redbell clarified. &quot;He’s an important figure. Trust me, it’s worth hearing him out. And I’ll explain a few things on the way.&quot;

Rowan nodded, slipping on his boots and following Redbell down the dimly lit corridor. The air in the bunker felt colder this morning, more charged, as if something significant was about to unfold.

As they walked, Redbell spoke quietly, his voice measured. 

&quot;The rebellion isn’t as unified as we like to pretend,&quot; he began. &quot;It’s made up of factions, different groups with different ideals. Some of them want democracy, others want a council. Hell, some think anarchy’s the way to go. But we all share the same goal: to make the Federation a better place.&quot;

Rowan frowned. &quot;By tearing it apart?&quot;

Redbell glanced at him, the corner of his mouth twitching into a faint smile. &quot;Not quite. The Federation’s a machine. A powerful one. But it&#39;s rusted, corrupted, and fed by the blood of its own people. We’re not here to destroy it, we’re here to fix it. Some factions have... questionable methods, though. You&#39;ll see what I mean soon enough.&quot;

They entered a larger chamber, one Rowan hadn’t seen before. It was filled with a lot of conversations, the occasional clink of weapons, and the scent of coffee and grease. At the far end of the room, seated at a table, was the scar-faced man Rowan had noticed the day before. His face was a roadmap of battles lost and won, his eyes piercing yet strangely weary.

&quot;Rowan, meet Commander Vale,&quot; Redbell said, motioning for Rowan to sit across from the man.

Commander Vale leaned forward, his hands on the table. &quot;So, you’re the newcomer,&quot; he said, his voice gravelly but firm. &quot;I’ve heard a bit about you. Survived a Federation transport. That’s no small feat.&quot;

Rowan shrugged uncomfortably. &quot;Luck, I guess.&quot;

Vale’s face twisted into a smirk. &quot;Luck doesn’t get you through what you’ve been through. Let’s not downplay your resilience.&quot; He leaned back, studying Rowan for a moment. &quot;We could use someone like you. But first, I need to know... why you’re really here. Is it revenge? Survival? Or something else?&quot;

Rowan hesitated, the memories of what the Federation had done to him bubbling to the surface. He clenched his fists under the table. &quot;They took everything from me,&quot; he said finally. &quot;Family. Friends. My life. I don’t know if I care about fixing the Federation. But I can’t sit by and do nothing anymore.&quot;

Vale nodded, his expression unreadable. &quot;Fair answer. Anger can be a good motivator, but it won’t sustain you. If you’re going to fight with us, you’ll need more than that. You’ll need purpose.&quot;

Redbell, standing by Rowan’s side, interjected. &quot;That’s why I brought him here, Commander.&quot;

Vale’s eyes shifted to Redbell briefly before returning to Rowan. &quot;Alright. Let’s start with the basics. We don’t force anyone to join. But if you want to make a difference, you’ll have to choose a side. And that choice might not be as simple as you think.&quot;

Vale stood, gesturing for Rowan to follow. They exited the chamber and entered a long hallway lined with banners, each one bearing the symbol of a different faction. 

Finally, he stopped in front of a banner with a broken gold crown. &quot;The Broken Crown. They believe the only way to fix the Federation is to tear it down entirely. Start fresh. But chaos has a cost, and not everyone’s willing to pay it.&quot;

Rowan stood there, staring at the banners, his mind racing. Redbell placed a hand on his shoulder. 

&quot;Take your time,&quot; he said. &quot;Think about what you want. Not just for yourself, but for everyone else who’s counting on us.&quot;

[[The Broken Crown   ]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="196" name="The Broken Crown" tags="" position="775,6725" size="100,100">The broken, scattered pieces of conversations and the distant voices reverberated off the walls of the crowded hallway. The activity here was unlike any Rowan had encountered before, it felt like a hive of purpose, alive with intention. 

Vale paused before a heavy door, its surface scratched and worn, the handle worn smooth by countless hands. He turned to Rowan, giving a reassuring nod. “This is it,” he said simply.

The door groaned as it slid open, revealing a room that could have once been a grand hall or a meeting space. Now, it was a controlled chaos, with broken furniture and makeshift tables scattered throughout the space. People moved between them, some sitting, others standing. Weapons, tools, and bits of technology littered the space. 

The room stilled as they entered, eyes lifting from whatever task or conversation they had been involved in. Rowan’s eyes scanned the faces before him. Some were hard, battle-worn, others youthful and full of hunger for something greater. Each person seemed to have a different type of intensity.

Vale stepped forward, and as he did, the crowd seemed to part, like a sea shifting to make way for something powerful. The leader of The Broken Crowns stood at the far end of the room, his back to them. He was tall, broad-shouldered, with a hardened face that had seen more than its fair share of battles. His clothing was practical, tactical even, layered with bits of worn armor and accessories that gave him an air of someone who’d seen the world from the outside and came back to claim his place. 

&quot;Rowan, meet the leader of The Broken Crowns,&quot; Vale spoke in a low tone. 

The leader turned, his eyes sharp, assessing Rowan with a brief but thorough glance. He didn’t smile or offer pleasantries; his demeanor was no-nonsense, as though time was something he had little to spare. Yet there was an undeniable sense of respect.

“Welcome to our home, Rowan,” the leader said, his voice deep and calm. “I am known as Talon, the leader of The Broken Crowns. We’re a faction of the overlooked, the discarded, those left behind by the Federation and its chokehold on this world. And you, Rowan, you’ve made a wise choice in seeking us out. Few have the courage to stand against the tide.”

Rowan could tell that Talon was sizing him up, just as he had with Vale. There was no judgment in his eyes, as if he were trying to determine whether Rowan was the ally he needed or just another passing face in a crowd.

“Thank you,” Rowan said. “I’m here to find a path that aligns with my goals. If you think I’m wise, then we’ll see if we can work together.”

Talon gave a slight nod, his face twitching in what could almost have been a smirk. “We don’t offer anyone salvation. You’ll have to carve your own way here. But you’ve chosen right. The Broken Crowns are not just a band of rebels, we’re a force of freedom.”

The leader stepped closer, his eyes narrowing as he studied Rowan. “Tell me, Rowan, do you have any experience with weapons? We fight battles where the gun in your hand is as important as the strength in your heart. Not every weapon is a sword or a blade. Some are designed to protect the power structures of the Federation.”

Rowan’s expression hardened. “I know my way around a weapon. You can say I’ve been trained.”

Talon’s expression softened just a touch, a feeling of approval crossing his features. “Good. Very good. But I hope you’re ready to handle more than just standard issue. These days, a man needs to be prepared for anything, and in our ranks, we need those who can handle more than just the typical.”

He motioned to a table near the back of the room, where several high-tech firearms lay scattered. “We have pulse rifles here, Federal ones, designed with biolocks embedded in their algorithms. No one outside the Federation could ever dream of unlocking them. They’re useless unless you’ve been specifically authorized by their DNA protocols. But you’re a wise one, I imagine you’ve thought about that, haven’t you?”

Rowan’s brow furrowed. He stepped closer to the table, his fingers grazing the sleek surface of the rifles. They were impressive, no doubt, but it was the lock in their systems that concerned him. “Once again, I know,” he said, eyes fixed on Talon. “But... how could anyone use them if they’re biolocked? You need to be coded, have the Federation’s DNA signatures to even fire them.”

Talon chuckled, a low, throaty sound that went around in the quiet room. “Ah, the biolock. The Federation’s most foolproof method of ensuring their weapons only work for their own. They think they’ve cornered the market, don’t they?”

He took a step toward Rowan, his eyes glinting with a dangerous knowledge. “We have our ways. The Broken Crowns have no shortage of data jackers, skilled technicians who can rewrite, rework, and unlock just about anything. Federal firearms are no exception. These aren’t just toys, Rowan. They’re tools, weapons designed to hold their own against the might of the Federation. We’ve got some of the best in the business, and they know how to force-unlock those weapons. Trust me when I say... it’s a great weapon to wield.”

Rowan nodded slowly, his eyes drifting back to the rifles. It was clear Talon wasn’t just speaking in hypotheticals. This was the reality of their operation. “So, you’ve got people who can hack into the Federation’s system? They can unlock these things and make them usable for anyone?” he asked, intrigued but still cautious.

Talon’s lips curled into a smile, though it was more like a snarl. “Not just anyone. But if you’re in our ranks, you’ll be ready to use them. And that’s what counts. You’ll see for yourself soon enough.”

Rowan could feel the decision pressing down on him as he looked from Talon to the pulse rifles on the table. This was the kind of weaponry he needed to survive in a world where control was everything, where the Federation held all the cards. And now, with The Broken Crowns, it seemed he might have a chance to tip the scales.

“I’m in,” Rowan said, his voice firm. “If you can unlock these weapons, then I’ll fight with you. Let’s see what kind of force we can become.”

Talon’s eyes sparkled with approval, and for the first time, his expression softened. “Welcome to The Broken Crowns, Rowan. You’ve chosen well.”

Talon leaned back slightly, his hands behind his back as he observed Rowan closely. The room seemed to tighten in anticipation of what was to come.

“There’s something I need you to do, Rowan,” he said, the edges of his words heavy with meaning. “A test of sorts. A way for you to prove you’re worthy of our cause.”

Rowan straightened, his eyes narrowing slightly as he studied Talon. The leader’s demeanor hadn’t changed; there was no sign of trickery, but there was no mistaking the fact that this task would be crucial.

“The factions like to band together to help each other reach their goals, but remember, Rowan, our ideals still differ in the end. One of us will have to take the throne of the Federation if we ever make it to the end of this war. But that’s a distant thought for now. Right now, it’s about proving loyalty to your people, your ideals. You’re going to do something that will set you apart.”

Rowan’s jaw clenched slightly. “What’s the job?”

Talon continued. “There’s a Broken Crown officer, one of ours, who’s been captured by the Federation. We know where he’s being held, but the detention facility is well-guarded. This isn’t a simple rescue mission, Rowan. You’ll need to be quick, decisive, and ruthless when necessary. We need him back, and I trust you can do it.”

Rowan paused, his mind working quickly. He didn’t hesitate for long. “I can do it. I know a guy who’d be perfect for this kind of job.”

Talon gave a slight nod of approval, his eyes filled with satisfaction. “Good. You’ll need all the help you can get. I’ll lend you a unit of men who know this mission well. It’s important to me that we gain an edge over the Federation, and this officer is crucial to our cause.”

“I agree,” Rowan said, his voice firm and clear. “I’ll get the job done.”

Talon nodded again, then gestured to the soldiers in the room. A sergeant stepped forward, his demeanor calm but alert. He was a tall, broad man with a hardened face, eyes that had seen the worst of the world and lived to tell about it.

The sergeant spoke first, his voice a low rumble. “I’ll be delighted to show you the way, Rowan. My name’s Mercer, and I know this mission inside and out.” He paused, sizing Rowan up for a moment before continuing. “If you’re up for it, I’ll make sure we get in, get the officer, and get out with minimal hassle.”

Rowan gave a small nod. “I appreciate it, Mercer.”

As the sergeant made his preparations, Rowan had went out of his way to find the man he wanted to bring, he turned to Kade, the familiar figure he had met in the infirmary. Kade was sitting near the back, checking over his gear. When Rowan’s eyes found him, Kade’s head snapped up. Recognition was in his eyes, followed by a knowing smile.

“Hey, Kade,” Rowan called, his voice steady. “You want to join us on a search-and-rescue mission?”

Kade grinned, standing up to join Rowan. “Hell yeah, I’m in. The Broken Crowns could use an engineer. I’m your man.”

Rowan could already sense that Kade’s skills would be invaluable. As a former Federal engineer, Kade was uniquely qualified to help them navigate the more technical aspects of their mission. Together, they would form a strong team, one that could handle both combat and the intricacies of the Federation’s security systems.

With everything set, the team made their way out to the VTOL waiting outside. The sky was dark, with clouds drifting lazily across the horizon. The VTOL’s engines was soft in the night air as the team boarded. The sleek, black vehicle was built for stealth, designed to blend in with the darkness and avoid detection. Its engines whined as it took off, lifting the group into the night sky and heading toward their destination.

The trip was mostly silent, save for the occasional exchange of words between the team. Mercer was focused on the mission. Rowan and Kade sat together, going over the details of the mission. Rowan explained the situation to Kade, who nodded along, already brainstorming ways to get past the Federation’s security systems.

“The Federation won’t make this easy,” Kade said, adjusting his gear. “But I’ll be able to work with whatever you throw at me. I’ve dealt with worse.”

Mercer’s voice broke through their conversation. “We’re getting close. The detention facility’s not far now.”

The VTOL descended gradually, avoiding the Federation’s radar systems by skimming low through the clouds. It touched down in a secluded area, between several mountains, its engines powering down as they landed in a small, hidden clearing. The landing zone was safe for now, but they would need to be careful.

As the team disembarked, Mercer led them through the dense underbrush. Rowan took in the surroundings as they moved, the dense forest around them adding to the sense of isolation. After a few minutes, Mercer spoke again, his voice low.

“Not far now. We’ll get close enough to make a final approach on foot.”

Rowan nodded, keeping his eyes sharp. “Who else is in your unit? Who are we working with?”

Mercer glanced back, his eyes reflecting the light from the surrounding trees. “We’ve got a recon specialist with us. He’ll be handling any engagements from a distance, sniper support, surveillance, and the like. He’s good, Rowan. You’ll want him on your side.”

Rowan raised an eyebrow. “What else?”

Mercer kept walking, his pace unbroken. “We’ve got a couple of other specialists, too. A demolitions expert, a tech officer, and a medic. Everyone’s here for a reason. We’ve trained together for this kind of mission. Now we just need to stick to the plan.”

The group continued forward, walking through the dense woods with Mercer leading them expertly through the terrain. Rowan glanced over at Kade.

“We’ll be good,” Rowan said. “Kade’s a Federal engineer. He’ll be able to hack into their systems if need be.”

Kade gave a small grin. “That’s the plan. But I’m not the only one with tricks up my sleeve.”

As the group made their way closer to the facility. they could see the lights of the detention facility in the distance. It was a massive structure, built to contain high-value prisoners, a fortress surrounded by high walls and guarded by Federation soldiers. The sight of it sent a shiver down Rowan’s spine. It was a place where escape was nearly impossible, and survival even harder.

The facility itself was complex, a series of high-tech buildings surrounded by electrified fences and heavy security. Watchtowers lined the perimeter, their red lights scanning the area for any signs of movement. Military soldiers patrolled the outer edges, their rifles scanning the terrain actively. Rowan’s eyes caught glimpses of the sentries on the walls, their patrols moving methodically, but they were still far enough away for them to make their move.

Mercer’s voice was a whisper in the dark. “We’ll need to approach from the west. There’s a blind spot in their security, and we can use it to slip inside. Once we’re in, we’ll have to move fast. No hesitation.”

Rowan nodded, his mind already running through the plan. “Let’s do it.”

The team moved through the forest. Mercer, the sergeant, led the way, as he led Rowan and Kade toward the west side of the detention facility. The dense underbrush and towering trees provided some cover, but the path ahead was still fraught with danger. Rowan stayed alert, his mind running through the possible scenarios in his head as they approached their destination.

Soon, they reached the designated recon point, a small rise that overlooked the perimeter of the facility. The recon specialist, was already in place, his long-range sniper rifle set up on a tripod and aimed at the facility. His eyes were locked on the movement of the guards below, monitoring their patrol routes. His presence was ghostlike, blending seamlessly into the night.

Mercer spoke low, his voice steady. &quot;Recon, what&#39;s the layout? We need to move in.&quot;

He barely moved, his eyes scanning the area through his binoculars. &quot;Two guards on each tower, two squads on the ground. Standard patrol routes. The security systems are tight, electrified fences, cameras on every corner. But there’s a gap to the west, a maintenance tunnel beneath the old wall. We can slip through there, but it&#39;s going to be a tight squeeze.&quot;

Rowan studied the area, his mind already mapping out the route. &quot;What about the fence? The alarms on it?&quot;

He looked down at his equipment, tapping his screen. &quot;The fence has a control box nearby, looks like a manual override for the alarms. We’ll need to disable it before crossing.&quot;

Kade spoke up, his voice calm but with a hint of excitement. &quot;I can handle that. I’ve worked with this tech before. Shouldn’t be a problem.&quot;

Mercer nodded, stepping aside. &quot;Good. Take the lead, Kade. We’re counting on you.&quot;

Kade gave a small grin and moved forward, checking his tools and his gear as they advanced. Rowan stayed close, his eyes darting between Kade and the patrolling guards. They had to stay low, and the slightest misstep could mean disaster.

As they approached the maintenance tunnel, Kade was already at work. He crouched down beside a set of exposed wires near the fence, his hands moving swiftly over the control panel. His eyes flicked back to Rowan. &quot;This is it. I’m shutting off the fence alarms. But listen,&quot; he added in a hushed tone, &quot;the Federation soldiers are all equipped with bio-sensors. If one of them flatlines, the alarms will go off, and they’ll be on us in seconds.&quot;

Rowan nodded. &quot;Understood.&quot;

The seconds stretched out as Kade worked quickly, his hands flying over the control panel. A soft click went through the silence as the alarms on the fence went quiet, signaling that they could move.

Mercer whispered, &quot;Move.&quot;

They slipped through the hole Kade had created, crawling beneath the electrified fence and into the cramped maintenance tunnel. The air was musty, stale from years of disuse, but it provided the cover they needed. They moved quickly, following Mercer’s lead as he navigated the dark, narrow passage.

As they moved deeper into the tunnel, the walls seemed to close in, the tightness of the space adding to the sense of urgency. 

Soon, they reached a set of rusted doors that led into the prison complex. Kade reached for the control panel beside the door, his fingers moving with ease as he attempted to hack into the system. A low buzz sounded, then a click. The door slid open, revealing a dimly lit corridor on the other side. The walls were lined with reinforced doors, the prison’s inner sanctum.

Mercer signaled for them to move forward. “We’ve got to move fast. The officer is being held in the lower levels. It’s going to be tight, but we have a good shot if we move quickly.”

As they moved deeper into the prison. The faint sounds of guards patrolling could be heard down the hall, and every corner they passed could hide an enemy. But for now, they remained undetected, slipping through the shadows as Mercer led them deeper into the facility.

But as they neared their destination, a sudden problem arose. A pair of guards appeared in the hallway ahead. The group froze, their bodies tensing as they tried to find a way to remain undetected.

Mercer held up his hand, signaling them to stop. His eyes scanned the surroundings quickly. &quot;We need a way out, now. If we don’t move fast enough, we’ll get spotted. But we can’t let that happen.&quot;

    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rowan leads the team straight ahead, ignoring the flashing &quot;Restricted Zone&quot; signs at the security checkpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Just as he approachs the gates, a sharp *beep-beep-beep* could be heard. The alarms screech to life, crimson lights spinning wildly overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh no, oh no, oh no,&quot; someone mutters under their breath as automated turrets begin coming to life, swiveling in his direction. Rowan&#39;s voice breaks through the chaos, &quot;Fall back! We’re screwed!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;But it’s too late. The heavy thud of boots signals the arrival of federal military personnel. Dozens pour into the corridor, weapons drawn, their bio-enhanced visors locking onto them instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Freeze!&quot; one of the soldiers yells, but no one has time to react. The first shot is fired, and all hell breaks loose. Bullets and pulse rounds rip through the air, leaving no room for survival.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The team is systematically wiped out. Rowan tries to return fire, but a well-placed shot takes him down before he can even aim.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Within moments, the corridor is silent again.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The world goes black instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="198" name=" Ventilation Shaft " tags="" position="850,6850" size="100,100">The squad went forward through the ventilation system. The confined space amplified the subtle scrape of their gear and the occasional creak of the metal beneath them. Rowan led the way, looking out for potential obstacles while Kade monitored their position on a compact schematic displayed on his wrist tablet.  

After navigating through several turns and drops, they found an opening that overlooked a dimly lit staff room. Below, a massive industrial fan dominated one wall, its blades spinning lazily as it cycled cool air throughout the facility.  

Rowan signaled for a stop and gestured for Kade to move forward. The engineer crawled beside him and peered through the grate. &quot;That fan leads to the room where the officer is being held,&quot; Kade whispered. &quot;It’s our way in.&quot;  

&quot;Can you disable it without tripping the system?&quot; Rowan asked, his voice barely audible.  
Kade smirked, pulling out a compact toolkit. &quot;Do you even need to ask?&quot;  

As Kade worked on loosening the grate, Mercer and Tessa took up defensive positions, watching the narrow vent for any sign of pursuit. Just as Kade finished removing the final bolt, Mercer froze. He raised a fist, a universal signal to halt. Everyone immediately went still.  

From below, the sound of heavy boots went through the room. The squad peered through the slats of the grate as the door swung open, revealing three massive figures.  
(text-colour:red)[Elite Honor Guards.  ]

The guards strode into the room. Their crimson cloaks swayed as they walked, the polished surface of their monotech goggles reflecting the dim light. Each one stood nearly eight feet tall. The leader of the trio carried an unsettling weapon at his side, a hilt that pulsed faintly with crimson light.  

Rowan tensed as the guards approached the Broken Crown Officer, who sat shackled to a heavy chair in the center of the room. Despite his injuries, the officer held his head high, his defiance undimmed.  

The lead Honor Guard’s voice was a low, mechanical growl as he spoke. &quot;We’ll ask one more time: What are your group’s intentions against High Command?&quot;  

The officer sneered, blood dripping from a cut on his lip. &quot;Go to hell.&quot;  

One of the guards stepped forward, the weapon at his side activating with a menacing snap-hiss. A crimson, unstable blade burst to life, its jagged edges crackling with raw energy. The guard brought it dangerously close to the officer’s face, the heat of the blade causing beads of sweat to form on the officer’s forehead.  

&quot;Talk,&quot; the guard demanded, his voice laced with menace. &quot;What do you know about the Federation’s defenses? What’s your plan?&quot;  

Rowan glanced at Mercer, who had already drawn his silenced weapon. A single nod from Rowan was all the confirmation Mercer needed.  

Kade leaned close to Rowan and whispered, &quot;The fan’s ready, but we’ve got to move fast.&quot;  

&quot;Stay here and hold the vent for us,&quot; Rowan ordered. &quot;We’ll need you to deploy the ladder when it’s time to exfil.&quot;  

Rowan signaled to the squad, and one by one, they silently descended into the staff room, using the now-stationary fan as their entry point.  

The first guard barely had time to register the faint shuffle of footsteps before Rowan’s blade pierced through the gap between his helmet and chest armor. The massive figure collapsed with a heavy thud. 

The second guard turned, raising his weapon, but Mercer’s silenced shot struck him squarely in the visor, shattering the monotech goggles and dropping him instantly.  

The third guard roared in rage, igniting his lightsaber as he lunged at Rowan. The unstable blade hissed and crackled, narrowly missing its mark. Rowan ducked beneath the swing and retaliated with a precise upward slash, his blade finding the vulnerable joint beneath the guard’s arm. The giant staggered, and Mercer delivered the final blow, her combat knife driving into the base of his skull.  

The room fell silent save for the faint hum of the deactivated lightsaber.  

Mercer nudged one of the fallen guards with his boot, his brow furrowed. &quot;That was too easy,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Elite Honor Guards are supposed to put up more of a fight.&quot;  

Before Rowan could respond, the shrill wail of an alarm pierced the air, bathing the room in a pulsating red light.  

&quot;Time’s up!&quot; Kade shouted from above. &quot;We’ve got company, move!&quot;  

The squad acted quickly, freeing the Broken Crown Officer from his restraints. The man was weak, but he managed to stand with their support.  

&quot;Up the ladder, now!&quot; Rowan barked, shoving the officer toward the deployable ladder Kade had lowered into the room.  

One by one, the squad climbed back into the ventilation shaft, Kade pulling up the ladder the moment everyone was aboard. He quickly reattached the fan, its blades whirring back to life just as the sound of boots thundered into the staff room below.  

From their hidden vantage point, Rowan watched as a squad of federal soldiers stormed into the room, their weapons drawn. They froze at the sight of the three dead Honor Guards.  

&quot;Targets are gone,&quot; one of the soldiers reported, his voice tense. &quot;The Honor Guards... they’re down. Repeat, they’re tagged as dead!&quot;  

Another soldier began giving orders into a comm unit, but it was too late. Rowan and his team were already deep in the ventilation system, heading toward their extraction point. 

&quot;That was cutting it close,&quot; Mercer muttered as he crawled ahead.  

Rowan glanced at Kade, who was securing the rear. &quot;Good work back there,&quot; Rowan said. &quot;We owe you.&quot;  

Kade wiped sweat from his brow and gave a tired grin. &quot;Just another day on the job.&quot;  

The squad went on, the distant alarms fading behind them as they disappeared into the vents, their mission far from over.  

With the Broken Crown Officer secured and the fan blades spinning once again, the squad moved swiftly back into the ventilation system. Drowned out by the blaring alarms going through the base. Red emergency lights pulsing in synchrony, casting shadows through the vents and grates. 

“Kade, how far?” Rowan whispered sharply.  

“Two more turns, then straight to the exit,” Kade replied, his eyes glued to the schematic displayed on his wrist tablet. Sweat dripped from his brow as he crawled ahead.  

Mercer helped the officer along, the man limping but still determined to escape. The officer’s breathing was labored, his face pale, but he said nothing, pushing himself to keep up.

Mercer activated his comm softly. “Recon, status?”  

“Perimeter’s swarming,” Recon replied in his usual calm tone. “Looks like they’re doing a sweep of the forest edge. I’ve taken out a few already. No chatter yet, seems they haven’t realized their comms are dead.”  

“Keep it that way,” Rowan interjected, his tone firm. “We can’t afford them calling for reinforcements here.”  

From his elevated vantage point outside the compound, Recon adjusted his scope. The digital display of his rifle overlaid critical information as he scanned the area. A group of guards patrolling near the main gate came into view. One guard paused, looking in the direction of the forest.  

Recon exhaled slowly, steadying his aim. The suppressor muffled the crack of his rifle as the first guard dropped silently, a clean shot through the neck. The second guard turned, his expression frozen in surprise, just as another shot found its hit.  

“Two down.” Recon murmured. “Keep moving. I’ll handle anyone who gets too close.”  

Inside the vent, the squad reached the final stretch leading to their entry point. The faint glow of moonlight spilled through the grate.  

“Kade, get that panel open,” Mercer ordered.  

Kade moved quickly, pulling out a compact tool to unscrew the bolts holding the grate in place. With a soft creak, it came loose, and he set it aside carefully.  

“Let’s go,” Rowan said, gesturing for Mercer and the officer to move first.  

The squad emerged into the open air, crouching low as they used the surrounding shadows for cover. The forest was ahead.  

“Recon, eyes up,” Rowan said.  

“Already on it,” Recon replied. He scanned the area again, spotting a pair of guards near a communications dish. One of them reached for his radio, likely to report in they found the team running away.  

&#39;&#39;Not happening.  &#39;&#39;

Recon adjusted his scope and fired, the first shot dropping the guard instantly. The second guard froze, looking around frantically before falling moments later.  

“Clear,” Recon confirmed. “You’re good to move. Stay low.”  

Mercer led the group into the forest, the dense canopy swallowing them in darkness. The officer stumbled once, but Mercer caught him, supporting him with an arm around his shoulders.  

The alarms from the base faded as they ventured deeper into the woods. The only sounds now were the rustling of leaves underfoot and the occasional distant call of wildlife.  

After what felt like hours, they reached the extraction point. The VTOL was already waiting, its engines sounding softly as its faint lights illuminated the clearing.  

“Move, move,” Mercer urged, helping the officer climb aboard.  

Rowan and Kade kept watch, their weapons focused on the treeline until everyone was safely inside. With a sharp hiss, the VTOL’s doors slid shut, and the craft lifted off, its engines roaring to life as it ascended into the night sky.  

Rowan exhaled deeply, leaning against the bulkhead as the adrenaline began to wear off. The officer, seated across from him, looked up with tired but grateful eyes.  

“Thank you,” the officer said, his voice heavy with emotion. “If you hadn’t come, I wouldn’t have lasted another day in there. I’ve been gathering intel for weeks... This is going to change everything.”  

Rowan managed a faint smile, nodding. “Glad we could help.”  

The VTOL soared over the forest, the lights of the enemy base growing faint in the distance. Inside, the squad allowed themselves a moment to decompress. Mercer checked his weapon, Tessa leaned back with her eyes closed, and Kade wiped sweat from his brow, glancing at the officer with a nod of respect.  

They landed at the Broken Crown outpost just as the sun dipped below the horizon. The VTOL’s doors hissed open, and the squad emerged. The officer, sided by Mercer and Kade, walked with a very relieved stride.  

Talon awaited them at the entrance of the bunker.

“You made it back. Well done. I am impressed you are all still alive.”  

The officer stepped forward. He reached into his pocket and retrieved a small, black data chip, holding it out toward Talon. “This is everything I’ve gathered over the past month. Movement patterns, supply chains, and, most critically, details on a transport coming from the Citadel. Whatever they’re moving is big, and they’ve gone to extreme lengths to protect it. They have a lot of Elite Honor Guards escorting it.”  

Talon took the chip, inspecting it briefly before sliding it into a reader attached to his wrist device. His eyes narrowed as he skimmed the initial files, the faint glow of the screen illuminating his hardened features.  

After a moment, Talon looked up. “If this transport is as important as you claim, why didn’t they wipe your memory after the intel was secured?” 

The officer hesitated, his hand brushing instinctively against his temple. “They couldn’t risk it. I made sure the data was encrypted in a way that required my own neural patterns to decode. It was risky, but it worked. They need me intact to access what I know.”  

Kade, standing off to the side, let out a low whistle. “Smart move. But now you’re a walking target.”  

The officer nodded. “Exactly. If this transport reaches its destination, it could shift the balance of this entire quiet war. We have to intercept it. The Citadel doesn&#39;t usually transport anything out from it.”

Talon’s brow furrowed as he processed the information. “What are they transporting?”  

The officer shook his head. “I don’t know for certain. What I do know is that it’s classified at the highest level. I’ve heard whispers in the prison, something about a prototype weapon, or maybe even a key Federation official being relocated. Either way, it’s vital enough for them to send one of their armored convoys straight from the Citadel.”  

Rowan, who had been silently observing, stepped forward. “If we intercept this convoy, it could give us leverage. Even if it’s not a weapon, capturing someone high up could tip the scales in our favor.”  

Talon nodded slowly. “Agreed. But this won’t be a simple hit-and-run. Federation convoys are fortified, and their escorts are ruthless. We’ll need a plan that doesn’t rely on brute force.”  

Mercer crossed his arms, his tone skeptical. “And what’s the timetable on this transport? We can’t just stumble into this unprepared.”  

The officer checked his wrist device, bringing up a holographic map of the surrounding area. A blinking red dot marked the convoy’s projected route. “It’s scheduled to pass through Sector 12 in Ontario in twelve hours. That gives us enough time to plan an ambush if we move quickly.”  

Talon’s lips curved into a faint, almost predatory smile. “Good. We’ll gather the team and prepare. This might be the opening we’ve been waiting for.”  

He turned to Rowan, his expression softening slightly. “You’ve earned your place here. And now, you’ll get the chance to prove it again. We will take the Transporter.”  

Rowan’s eyes widened. “Understood, sir.”  

Talon clapped him on the shoulder. “We’ll need every ounce of skill you’ve got, soldier. Dismissed.”  

Rowan nodded and made his way to the dormitory. As he reached his bunk, he sat down heavily, his mind racing with thoughts of the mission ahead. He knew there was no room for hesitation.  

[[DREAM.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="199" name="DREAM." tags="" position="850,6975" size="100,100">&lt;!-- Dream Sequence Passage --&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Georgia&#39;, serif; color: #2a2a2a; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8; text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;&quot;&gt;
  Rowan feels his mind drifting, his body weightless as if floating in a sea of warmth. The darkness around him begins to fade, and slowly, a soft light emerges. The air is calm, filling him with a sense of peace he hasn&#39;t known for years. There&#39;s no war here. No fighting. Just... &lt;strong style=&quot;color: #4b9cd3;&quot;&gt;quiet.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em style=&quot;color: #ff6347;&quot;&gt;Just peace.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Georgia&#39;, serif; color: #2a2a2a; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8; text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;&quot;&gt;
  He begins to see a figure ahead of him, moving slowly toward him. She is a woman, tall yet graceful, with a serene aura surrounding her. Her hair flows like a river of gold, and her eyes shine with kindness, radiating warmth. Rowan feels an odd but comforting pull toward her, his heart calming with every step. &lt;strong style=&quot;color: #ff6347;&quot;&gt;She is the embodiment of peace.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Georgia&#39;, serif; color: #2a2a2a; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8; text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;&quot;&gt;
  The world around them is vast and endless, an endless meadow stretching beneath a gentle blue sky. The flowers sway gently in the breeze, their vibrant colors alive with subtle light. It’s a place of stillness, where everything seems to be in harmony. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff6347;&quot;&gt;Time here seems irrelevant&lt;/span&gt;, as if it stands still, allowing Rowan to feel every emotion flowing through him without the weight of reality.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Georgia&#39;, serif; color: #2a2a2a; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8; text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;&quot;&gt;
  The woman stops before him, her smile soft but knowing. She speaks, her voice a whisper of wind, so light that it feels like it&#39;s brushing against his very soul. &lt;em style=&quot;color: #ff6347;&quot;&gt;“You’ve fought for so long. You’ve given everything. But you’re more than just a soldier. You’re more than the battles you&#39;ve fought.”&lt;/em&gt; Her words wrap around him like a comforting blanket.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Georgia&#39;, serif; color: #2a2a2a; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8; text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;&quot;&gt;
  Rowan opens his mouth to speak, but the words don’t come. The moment feels too perfect for words, too peaceful for anything but silence. And yet, somehow, he knows what she means. He feels the weight of his past lifting, his shoulders relaxing as if the burdens of the world have been gently placed down. &lt;strong style=&quot;color: #4b9cd3;&quot;&gt;For once, he feels light.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Georgia&#39;, serif; color: #2a2a2a; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8; text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;&quot;&gt;
  She reaches out, her hand warm and soft as it rests lightly on his arm. Rowan feels a surge of warmth flood through him. It’s a feeling he has never known. A connection so pure, so real, that it fills the deepest parts of his soul. He is not alone. &lt;em style=&quot;color: #ff6347;&quot;&gt;He has worth.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong style=&quot;color: #4b9cd3;&quot;&gt;He belongs.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Georgia&#39;, serif; color: #2a2a2a; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8; text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;&quot;&gt;
  “There is no war here,” she says, her voice in his mind. “No strife, no sorrow. Just rest. You’ve earned it.” Her eyes holds his, and Rowan feels an overwhelming sense of belonging, as if this place is his true home, a sanctuary of peace. &lt;strong style=&quot;color: #ff6347;&quot;&gt;Peace at last.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Georgia&#39;, serif; color: #2a2a2a; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8; text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;&quot;&gt;
  Rowan steps forward, drawn to her like a moth to a flame, but this flame doesn’t burn. It illuminates. It reassures. He feels no fear, no hesitation. In this dream, nothing is impossible. The pain he’s carried for so long vanishes, replaced by a calm understanding. &lt;em style=&quot;color: #4b9cd3;&quot;&gt;He is finally at peace.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Georgia&#39;, serif; color: #2a2a2a; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8; text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;&quot;&gt;
  “You are worthy,” she says softly. “Worthy of rest, worthy of love, worthy of peace.” Her hands cradle his face, and Rowan feels a peace that he&#39;s never known, deeper than sleep, deeper than anything he&#39;s ever experienced. &lt;strong style=&quot;color: #ff6347;&quot;&gt;Worthy of love.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Georgia&#39;, serif; color: #2a2a2a; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8; text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;&quot;&gt;
  The dream continues in silence, a timeless place where the world melts away. The warmth of her presence surrounds him, as if everything that ever hurt him had been undone. For once, Rowan is free. &lt;strong style=&quot;color: #ff6347;&quot;&gt;Free from pain, free from fear.&lt;/strong&gt; All that remains is peace.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Georgia&#39;, serif; color: #2a2a2a; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8; text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;&quot;&gt;
  As the dream begins to fade, she whispers once more. &lt;em style=&quot;color: #ff6347;&quot;&gt;&quot;You are worthy of peace. Always remember that.&quot; &lt;/em&gt; Her voice lingers as the dream slips away, leaving him with an unshakable sense of calm.
&lt;/p&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="200" name="Awaken. " tags="" position="850,7100" size="100,100">“Rise and shine, man,” Kade said, his voice low but insistent. “Talon wants us ready in an hour. We’ve got to eat before we head out.”

Rowan groaned, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. His body protested every movement, the dull ache of exhaustion settling deep in his muscles. But he knew better than to complain. He swung his legs over the side of the bunk and grabbed his boots.

The two made their way through the bunker’s dimly lit corridors. When they reached the cafeteria sector, it was already filled with activity. Soldiers in mismatched uniforms stood in line, their voices of conversation as they waited for their turn at the ration counter. Kade and Rowan fell into line.

As they approached the counter, Rowan caught sight of the food being served: real food. Plates were laden with thick slices of bread, stews that steamed with the aroma of actual spices, and even small servings of fruit. It was a far cry from the Federation’s infamous “nourishment slop” a bland, gray paste that offered sustenance but no joy.

Kade raised an eyebrow as he took his tray. “Well, I’ll be damned. It’s been years since I’ve seen food that doesn’t look like it came out of a tube.” He grabbed his portion eagerly, his eyes lighting up as he inspected the contents.

Rowan followed suit, taking his own tray and looking at the offerings. The bread was fresh enough to still be soft, the stew rich with chunks of meat and vegetables, and the apple on the side. He hadn’t realized how hungry he was until now.

They found a table near the edge of the room, away from the noisier clusters of soldiers. Kade wasted no time digging in, a satisfied groan escaping his lips as he chewed. “This is good,” he said between bites, pointing his spoon at Rowan. “Way better than what the Federation gave us. I don’t even care if it’s rationed. It’s actual food.”

Rowan nodded as he took a bite of bread, the taste a welcome surprise. “Yeah, it’s good. Almost makes you forget where we are.”

Kade chuckled, shaking his head. “Almost.” His expression growing more serious. “So, what do you think’s in that transport truck we’re after? Talon wouldn’t have us moving this fast if it wasn’t something big.”

Rowan leaned back slightly, his eyes narrowing as he considered the question. “If I had to guess? A superweapon. Something they need to move off-shore. They’re always sending things to and from the Citadel, loading them onto ships or subs. But nobody knows where they’re taking them.”

Kade set his spoon down, his brow furrowing. “You think it’s something they’re hiding out at sea?”

“Maybe,” Rowan said. “They’ve got to be good at hiding things if we haven’t found out where their transports go by now. Whatever it is, though, it’s big enough to have them scrambling. This time, we get answers. But whatever it is they aren&#39;t taking it off shore if its toward Sector 12, thats away from the east.”

Kade nodded slowly, his eyes distant as he processed Rowan’s words. “Yeah. It’ll be nice to finally know what they’re up to. Feels like we’re always fighting in the dark, reacting to their moves instead of making our own.”

Rowan picked up his spoon, swirling it absently in the stew. “That’s why this mission matters. If we can intercept that convoy, we might finally be able to hit them where it hurts. But we’ve got to be smart about it. They’ll be ready for us.”

Kade smirked, his usual confidence returning. “That’s why they’ve got us. We’re the ones who can pull this off.”

Rowan didn’t respond immediately, his focus on the task ahead. He couldn’t afford to let himself relax, not entirely. The stakes were too high, and the Federation wouldn’t let something this important slip through their fingers without a fight.

“Finish up,” Rowan said finally, his tone firm but calm. “We need to be ready.”

Kade grinned, shoveling the last of his food into his mouth. “Yes, sir,” he said with mock seriousness, earning a faint smirk from Rowan.

The moment the call came, the bunker was a whirlwind of motion. Activity filled the hallways as everyone scrambled to prepare for probably the most critical mission the rebellion had faced. There was no turning back now. Rowan grabbed his gear, his heart pounding in his chest. Today, they would make their move against the Federation. Today, they would strike at the Citadel’s artery.

Rowan had heard whispers of the hangar bay deep beneath the surface, but nothing had prepared him for the vast scale of it. When he and Kade arrived, the sheer size of the underground facility took his breath away. The bunker’s architecture was nothing short of breathtaking. What appeared to be a cavernous space had been transformed into a state-of-the-art military hub, high-tech, secure, and almost impossibly vast for being so deep beneath the earth’s surface. The ceiling stretched far above them, crisscrossed with thick beams of reinforced metal, while the floor was a maze of launch pads, storage areas, and repair bays.

Every inch of the hangar was carefully designed, the space clearly having been constructed over years of painstaking work. It was hard for Rowan to wrap his mind around the fact that this was an underground facility, let alone the fact that a place this grand was hidden beneath miles of earth and rock. The rebels had truly built something remarkable here, something that would give them a fighting chance.

They moved quickly through the massive space, the sound of engines revving and machinery as various groups prepared for their assigned missions. The Citadel’s transport was the key to everything. If they could get their hands on the intel hidden in that convoy, they could shift the tide of the rebellion.

&quot;Over here,&quot; Kade muttered, pointing toward the Manticore VTOL positioned at the first square. The sleek, black craft, its sharp edges and advanced design making it look more like a predator ready to strike than a simple transport vehicle. The Manticore belonged to the Federation.

The Manticore was quick, stealthy, and ideally suited for the mission. Its low profile would make it difficult for anyone to track once they were airborne, and it was equipped with all the necessary tools to make the trip to Sector 13 undetected. But there was one problem: they weren’t the Federation. They were a ragtag group of rebels, and every move they made had to be measured.

As they approached the Manticore, Rowan noticed the team already waiting for them. There were six of them—rebels, no doubt, but their uniforms were a mismatched patchwork of stolen Federation gear, old military clothing, and anything they could scrounge up. Despite the uncoordinated appearance, there was no mistaking the determination in their eyes. This team had been through a lot together, and they would need every ounce of that grit to pull off their plan.

&quot;Everyone’s in place,&quot; Kade said, scanning the group. &quot;Ready to roll?&quot;

Rowan nodded, adjusting his gear as he climbed into the Manticore, the craft’s interior a mix of high-tech consoles and rugged, military-grade equipment. The team filed in behind him, taking their seats as the engines hummed to life, a low growl that vibrated through the hull. A quick briefing followed: they were to pose as a cargo drop-off ship from the Federation, nothing more. Their target was Sector 13, and they needed to blend in with the regular transport convoys until they could intercept the Citadel transport. It had to be quick, clean, and, most importantly, undetected.

The roof of the hangar slowly began to slide open as the Manticore lifted off. The sky above them revealed itself, a dark, clouded expanse that stretched on infinitely. Wind rushed through the open hatch as the craft rose, the rumble of its engines vibrating through the air. They were on their way.

&quot;Stay sharp,&quot; Kade’s voice came over the comms, low but steady. &quot;We’re about to hit Federation airspace.&quot;

Rowan’s pulse quickened, the adrenaline starting to course through his veins. They were getting close. Sector 13 was a critical landing zone—an area heavily guarded by Federation forces. If they made even the slightest mistake, the entire mission would be compromised.

The Manticore streaked through the sky, cutting through the clouds with eerie precision, blending into the shadows as they neared the landing zone. They had to move fast. The Federation wouldn’t be fooled for long. They were going to have to pull off this ruse with a level of skill and deceit that would make even the most seasoned operatives impressed.

As they neared the landing zone, the comms crackled, and the voice of an inspector came through. &quot;Manticore, this is Federation Control. You’ve arrived earlier than expected. State your purpose.&quot;

One of the rebels, a tall woman with sharp eyes and quick reflexes, glanced over at the rest of the team before moving toward the cockpit. She pulled out a weapon, the cold metal glinting in the dim light, and aimed it at the inspector’s voice.

&quot;Get inside, and don’t make a sound,&quot; she said, her voice steely. &quot;You’re going to ‘inspect’ us. Clear?&quot;

The inspector’s response was almost too calm. There was a long pause before the voice came back over the comms, almost unnervingly calm. &quot;Understood. Stand by for inspection.&quot;

Rowan’s hand instinctively gripped the edge of his seat. The inspector was too composed. If they were going to pull this off, they couldn’t afford a mistake. The Manticore’s doors slid open just slightly, the crack wide enough for the rebel to step out and force the inspector inside. He had no choice but to comply, entering the ship with a stiff posture. As the rebel moved to clear the area on her datapad, Rowan could see the subtle shift in the inspector’s eyes—a glimmer of realization.

Before the inspector could react, the rebel swiftly knocked him out, the sudden movement so quick and precise it was as if they’d rehearsed it a hundred times. Rowan didn’t flinch. They couldn’t afford hesitation. They had to be swift, lethal, and efficient.

The team moved like a well-oiled machine, flowing out of the Manticore and into the darkness, disappearing into the shadows of the landing zone. Their objective was clear: make it to Sector 12, and wait for the Citadel transport to arrive.

As they moved through the shadows, Rowan could feel the tension mounting. The next part of their mission was even more critical. The Citadel transport had just arrived, guarded by two heavily armored Elite Honor Guard vehicles, their presence a clear sign of how important this shipment was. The gunman in the front was alert, scanning for threats, while another sat in the back, watching the horizon. Rowan’s heart raced. The Elite Honor Guards were dangerous. Any misstep could spell disaster.

The team huddled in a nearby alcove, blending into the surroundings as they waited for the transport to pass. Every shadow was a potential threat, every movement under the harsh floodlights a risk. They couldn’t afford to make a sound. The Honor Guards were too skilled—they could spot even the smallest anomaly in the shadows. One wrong move, and their mission would end before it had even begun.

Rowan crouched low, his breath steady, his focus unwavering. This was it. The moment of truth. The Citadel transport would pass by, and they would make their move. But first, they had to stay hidden—quiet, unseen, until the time was right.

It was only a matter of moments now. The transport was close. The Honor Guards were on alert, but they hadn’t spotted them yet. The tension in the air was palpable.

Everything was riding on this next move. And Rowan was ready.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="201" name="The Broken Crown " tags="" position="925,6725" size="100,100">The broken, scattered pieces of conversations and the distant voices reverberated off the walls of the crowded hallway. The activity here was unlike any Rowan had encountered before, it felt like a hive of purpose, alive with intention. 

Vale paused before a heavy door, its surface scratched and worn, the handle worn smooth by countless hands. He turned to Rowan, giving a reassuring nod. “This is it,” he said simply.

The door groaned as it slid open, revealing a room that could have once been a grand hall or a meeting space. Now, it was a controlled chaos, with broken furniture and makeshift tables scattered throughout the space. People moved between them, some sitting, others standing. Weapons, tools, and bits of technology littered the space. 

The room stilled as they entered, eyes lifting from whatever task or conversation they had been involved in. Rowan’s eyes scanned the faces before him. Some were hard, battle-worn, others youthful and full of hunger for something greater. Each person seemed to have a different type of intensity.

Vale stepped forward, and as he did, the crowd seemed to part, like a sea shifting to make way for something powerful. The leader of The Broken Crowns stood at the far end of the room, his back to them. He was tall, broad-shouldered, with a hardened face that had seen more than its fair share of battles. His clothing was practical, tactical even, layered with bits of worn armor and accessories that gave him an air of someone who’d seen the world from the outside and came back to claim his place. 

&quot;Rowan, meet the leader of The Broken Crowns,&quot; Vale spoke in a low tone. 

The leader turned, his eyes sharp, assessing Rowan with a brief but thorough glance. He didn’t smile or offer pleasantries; his demeanor was no-nonsense, as though time was something he had little to spare. Yet there was an undeniable sense of respect.

“Welcome to our home, Rowan,” the leader said, his voice deep and calm. “I am known as Talon, the leader of The Broken Crowns. We’re a faction of the overlooked, the discarded, those left behind by the Federation and its chokehold on this world. And you, Rowan, you’ve made a wise choice in seeking us out. Few have the courage to stand against the tide.”

Rowan could tell that Talon was sizing him up, just as he had with Vale. There was no judgment in his eyes, as if he were trying to determine whether Rowan was the ally he needed or just another passing face in a crowd.

“Thank you,” Rowan said. “I’m here to find a path that aligns with my goals. If you think I’m wise, then we’ll see if we can work together.”

Talon gave a slight nod, his face twitching in what could almost have been a smirk. “We don’t offer anyone salvation. You’ll have to carve your own way here. But you’ve chosen right. The Broken Crowns are not just a band of rebels, we’re a force of freedom.”

The leader stepped closer, his eyes narrowing as he studied Rowan. “Tell me, Rowan, do you have any experience with weapons? We fight battles where the gun in your hand is as important as the strength in your heart. Not every weapon is a sword or a blade. Some are designed to protect the power structures of the Federation.”

Rowan’s expression hardened. “I know my way around a weapon. You can say I’ve been trained.”

Talon’s expression softened just a touch, a feeling of approval crossing his features. “Good. Very good. But I hope you’re ready to handle more than just standard issue. These days, a man needs to be prepared for anything, and in our ranks, we need those who can handle more than just the typical.”

He motioned to a table near the back of the room, where several high-tech firearms lay scattered. “We have pulse rifles here, Federal ones, designed with biolocks embedded in their algorithms. No one outside the Federation could ever dream of unlocking them. They’re useless unless you’ve been specifically authorized by their DNA protocols. But you’re a wise one, I imagine you’ve thought about that, haven’t you?”

Rowan’s brow furrowed. He stepped closer to the table, his fingers grazing the sleek surface of the rifles. They were impressive, no doubt, but it was the lock in their systems that concerned him. “Once again, I know,” he said, eyes fixed on Talon. “But... how could anyone use them if they’re biolocked? You need to be coded, have the Federation’s DNA signatures to even fire them.”

Talon chuckled, a low, throaty sound that went around in the quiet room. “Ah, the biolock. The Federation’s most foolproof method of ensuring their weapons only work for their own. They think they’ve cornered the market, don’t they?”

He took a step toward Rowan, his eyes glinting with a dangerous knowledge. “We have our ways. The Broken Crowns have no shortage of data jackers, skilled technicians who can rewrite, rework, and unlock just about anything. Federal firearms are no exception. These aren’t just toys, Rowan. They’re tools, weapons designed to hold their own against the might of the Federation. We’ve got some of the best in the business, and they know how to force-unlock those weapons. Trust me when I say... it’s a great weapon to wield.”

Rowan nodded slowly, his eyes drifting back to the rifles. It was clear Talon wasn’t just speaking in hypotheticals. This was the reality of their operation. “So, you’ve got people who can hack into the Federation’s system? They can unlock these things and make them usable for anyone?” he asked, intrigued but still cautious.

Talon’s lips curled into a smile, though it was more like a snarl. “Not just anyone. But if you’re in our ranks, you’ll be ready to use them. And that’s what counts. You’ll see for yourself soon enough.”

Rowan could feel the decision pressing down on him as he looked from Talon to the pulse rifles on the table. This was the kind of weaponry he needed to survive in a world where control was everything, where the Federation held all the cards. And now, with The Broken Crowns, it seemed he might have a chance to tip the scales.

“I’m in,” Rowan said, his voice firm. “If you can unlock these weapons, then I’ll fight with you. Let’s see what kind of force we can become.”

Talon’s eyes sparkled with approval, and for the first time, his expression softened. “Welcome to The Broken Crowns, Rowan. You’ve chosen well.”

Talon leaned back slightly, his hands behind his back as he observed Rowan closely. The room seemed to tighten in anticipation of what was to come.

“There’s something I need you to do, Rowan,” he said, the edges of his words heavy with meaning. “A test of sorts. A way for you to prove you’re worthy of our cause.”

Rowan straightened, his eyes narrowing slightly as he studied Talon. The leader’s demeanor hadn’t changed; there was no sign of trickery, but there was no mistaking the fact that this task would be crucial.

“The factions like to band together to help each other reach their goals, but remember, Rowan, our ideals still differ in the end. One of us will have to take the throne of the Federation if we ever make it to the end of this war. But that’s a distant thought for now. Right now, it’s about proving loyalty to your people, your ideals. You’re going to do something that will set you apart.”

Rowan’s jaw clenched slightly. “What’s the job?”

Talon continued. “There’s a Broken Crown officer, one of ours, who’s been captured by the Federation. We know where he’s being held, but the detention facility is well-guarded. This isn’t a simple rescue mission, Rowan. You’ll need to be quick, decisive, and ruthless when necessary. We need him back, and I trust you can do it.”

Rowan paused, his mind working quickly. He didn’t hesitate for long. “I can do it. I know a guy who’d be perfect for this kind of job.”

Talon gave a slight nod of approval, his eyes filled with satisfaction. “Good. You’ll need all the help you can get. I’ll lend you a unit of men who know this mission well. It’s important to me that we gain an edge over the Federation, and this officer is crucial to our cause.”

“I agree,” Rowan said, his voice firm and clear. “I’ll get the job done.”

Talon nodded again, then gestured to the soldiers in the room. A sergeant stepped forward, his demeanor calm but alert. He was a tall, broad man with a hardened face, eyes that had seen the worst of the world and lived to tell about it.

The sergeant spoke first, his voice a low rumble. “I’ll be delighted to show you the way, Rowan. My name’s Mercer, and I know this mission inside and out.” He paused, sizing Rowan up for a moment before continuing. “If you’re up for it, I’ll make sure we get in, get the officer, and get out with minimal hassle.”

Rowan gave a small nod. “I appreciate it, Mercer.”

As the sergeant made his preparations, Rowan had went out of his way to find the man he wanted to bring, he turned to Kade, the familiar figure he had met in the infirmary. Kade was sitting near the back, checking over his gear. When Rowan’s eyes found him, Kade’s head snapped up. Recognition was in his eyes, followed by a knowing smile.

“Hey, Kade,” Rowan called, his voice steady. “You want to join us on a search-and-rescue mission?”

Kade grinned, standing up to join Rowan. “Hell yeah, I’m in. The Broken Crowns could use an engineer. I’m your man.”

Rowan could already sense that Kade’s skills would be invaluable. As a former Federal engineer, Kade was uniquely qualified to help them navigate the more technical aspects of their mission. Together, they would form a strong team, one that could handle both combat and the intricacies of the Federation’s security systems.

With everything set, the team made their way out to the VTOL waiting outside. The sky was dark, with clouds drifting lazily across the horizon. The VTOL’s engines was soft in the night air as the team boarded. The sleek, black vehicle was built for stealth, designed to blend in with the darkness and avoid detection. Its engines whined as it took off, lifting the group into the night sky and heading toward their destination.

The trip was mostly silent, save for the occasional exchange of words between the team. Mercer was focused on the mission. Rowan and Kade sat together, going over the details of the mission. Rowan explained the situation to Kade, who nodded along, already brainstorming ways to get past the Federation’s security systems.

“The Federation won’t make this easy,” Kade said, adjusting his gear. “But I’ll be able to work with whatever you throw at me. I’ve dealt with worse.”

Mercer’s voice broke through their conversation. “We’re getting close. The detention facility’s not far now.”

The VTOL descended gradually, avoiding the Federation’s radar systems by skimming low through the clouds. It touched down in a secluded area, between several mountains, its engines powering down as they landed in a small, hidden clearing. The landing zone was safe for now, but they would need to be careful.

As the team disembarked, Mercer led them through the dense underbrush. Rowan took in the surroundings as they moved, the dense forest around them adding to the sense of isolation. After a few minutes, Mercer spoke again, his voice low.

“Not far now. We’ll get close enough to make a final approach on foot.”

Rowan nodded, keeping his eyes sharp. “Who else is in your unit? Who are we working with?”

Mercer glanced back, his eyes reflecting the light from the surrounding trees. “We’ve got a recon specialist with us. He’ll be handling any engagements from a distance, sniper support, surveillance, and the like. He’s good, Rowan. You’ll want him on your side.”

Rowan raised an eyebrow. “What else?”

Mercer kept walking, his pace unbroken. “We’ve got a couple of other specialists, too. A demolitions expert, a tech officer, and a medic. Everyone’s here for a reason. We’ve trained together for this kind of mission. Now we just need to stick to the plan.”

The group continued forward, walking through the dense woods with Mercer leading them expertly through the terrain. Rowan glanced over at Kade.

“We’ll be good,” Rowan said. “Kade’s a Federal engineer. He’ll be able to hack into their systems if need be.”

Kade gave a small grin. “That’s the plan. But I’m not the only one with tricks up my sleeve.”

As the group made their way closer to the facility. they could see the lights of the detention facility in the distance. It was a massive structure, built to contain high-value prisoners, a fortress surrounded by high walls and guarded by Federation soldiers. The sight of it sent a shiver down Rowan’s spine. It was a place where escape was nearly impossible, and survival even harder.

The facility itself was complex, a series of high-tech buildings surrounded by electrified fences and heavy security. Watchtowers lined the perimeter, their red lights scanning the area for any signs of movement. Military soldiers patrolled the outer edges, their rifles scanning the terrain actively. Rowan’s eyes caught glimpses of the sentries on the walls, their patrols moving methodically, but they were still far enough away for them to make their move.

Mercer’s voice was a whisper in the dark. “We’ll need to approach from the west. There’s a blind spot in their security, and we can use it to slip inside. Once we’re in, we’ll have to move fast. No hesitation.”

Rowan nodded, his mind already running through the plan. “Let’s do it.”

The team moved through the forest. Mercer, the sergeant, led the way, as he led Rowan and Kade toward the west side of the detention facility. The dense underbrush and towering trees provided some cover, but the path ahead was still fraught with danger. Rowan stayed alert, his mind running through the possible scenarios in his head as they approached their destination.

Soon, they reached the designated recon point, a small rise that overlooked the perimeter of the facility. The recon specialist, was already in place, his long-range sniper rifle set up on a tripod and aimed at the facility. His eyes were locked on the movement of the guards below, monitoring their patrol routes. His presence was ghostlike, blending seamlessly into the night.

Mercer spoke low, his voice steady. &quot;Recon, what&#39;s the layout? We need to move in.&quot;

He barely moved, his eyes scanning the area through his binoculars. &quot;Two guards on each tower, two squads on the ground. Standard patrol routes. The security systems are tight, electrified fences, cameras on every corner. But there’s a gap to the west, a maintenance tunnel beneath the old wall. We can slip through there, but it&#39;s going to be a tight squeeze.&quot;

Rowan studied the area, his mind already mapping out the route. &quot;What about the fence? The alarms on it?&quot;

He looked down at his equipment, tapping his screen. &quot;The fence has a control box nearby, looks like a manual override for the alarms. We’ll need to disable it before crossing.&quot;

Kade spoke up, his voice calm but with a hint of excitement. &quot;I can handle that. I’ve worked with this tech before. Shouldn’t be a problem.&quot;

Mercer nodded, stepping aside. &quot;Good. Take the lead, Kade. We’re counting on you.&quot;

Kade gave a small grin and moved forward, checking his tools and his gear as they advanced. Rowan stayed close, his eyes darting between Kade and the patrolling guards. They had to stay low, and the slightest misstep could mean disaster.

As they approached the maintenance tunnel, Kade was already at work. He crouched down beside a set of exposed wires near the fence, his hands moving swiftly over the control panel. His eyes flicked back to Rowan. &quot;This is it. I’m shutting off the fence alarms. But listen,&quot; he added in a hushed tone, &quot;the Federation soldiers are all equipped with bio-sensors. If one of them flatlines, the alarms will go off, and they’ll be on us in seconds.&quot;

Rowan nodded. &quot;Understood.&quot;

The seconds stretched out as Kade worked quickly, his hands flying over the control panel. A soft click went through the silence as the alarms on the fence went quiet, signaling that they could move.

Mercer whispered, &quot;Move.&quot;

They slipped through the hole Kade had created, crawling beneath the electrified fence and into the cramped maintenance tunnel. The air was musty, stale from years of disuse, but it provided the cover they needed. They moved quickly, following Mercer’s lead as he navigated the dark, narrow passage.

As they moved deeper into the tunnel, the walls seemed to close in, the tightness of the space adding to the sense of urgency. 

Soon, they reached a set of rusted doors that led into the prison complex. Kade reached for the control panel beside the door, his fingers moving with ease as he attempted to hack into the system. A low buzz sounded, then a click. The door slid open, revealing a dimly lit corridor on the other side. The walls were lined with reinforced doors, the prison’s inner sanctum.

Mercer signaled for them to move forward. “We’ve got to move fast. The officer is being held in the lower levels. It’s going to be tight, but we have a good shot if we move quickly.”

As they moved deeper into the prison. The faint sounds of guards patrolling could be heard down the hall, and every corner they passed could hide an enemy. But for now, they remained undetected, slipping through the shadows as Mercer led them deeper into the facility.

But as they neared their destination, a sudden problem arose. A pair of guards appeared in the hallway ahead. The group froze, their bodies tensing as they tried to find a way to remain undetected.

Mercer held up his hand, signaling them to stop. His eyes scanned the surroundings quickly. &quot;We need a way out, now. If we don’t move fast enough, we’ll get spotted. But we can’t let that happen.&quot;

[[ Straight Ahead ]]

The activity here was unlike any Rowan had encountered before, it felt like a hive of purpose, alive with intention. 

Vale paused before a heavy door, its surface scratched and worn, the handle worn smooth by countless hands. He turned to Rowan, giving a reassuring nod. “This is it,” he said simply.

The door groaned as it slid open, revealing a room that could have once been a grand hall or a meeting space. Now, it was a controlled chaos, with broken furniture and makeshift tables scattered throughout the space. People moved between them, some sitting, others standing. Weapons, tools, and bits of technology littered the space. 

The room stilled as they entered, eyes lifting from whatever task or conversation they had been involved in. Rowan’s eyes scanned the faces before him. Some were hard, battle-worn, others youthful and full of hunger for something greater. Each person seemed to have a different type of intensity.

Vale stepped forward, and as he did, the crowd seemed to part, like a sea shifting to make way for something powerful. The leader of The Broken Crowns stood at the far end of the room, his back to them. He was tall, broad-shouldered, with a hardened face that had seen more than its fair share of battles.

Rowan nodded. &quot;Understood.&quot;

The seconds stretched out as Kade worked quickly, his hands flying over the control panel. A soft click went through the silence as the alarms on the fence went quiet, signaling that they could move.

Mercer whispered, &quot;Move.&quot;

They slipped through the hole Kade had created, crawling beneath the electrified fence and into the cramped maintenance tunnel. The air was musty, stale from years of disuse, but it provided the cover they needed. They moved quickly, following Mercer’s lead as he navigated the dark, narrow passage.

As they moved deeper into the tunnel, the walls seemed to close in, the tightness of the space adding to the sense of urgency. 

Soon, they reached a set of rusted doors that led into the prison complex. Kade reached for the control panel beside the door, his fingers moving with ease as he attempted to hack into the system. A low buzz sounded, then a click. The door slid open, revealing a dimly lit corridor on the other side. The walls were lined with reinforced doors, the prison’s inner sanctum.

Mercer signaled for them to move forward. “We’ve got to move fast. The officer is being held in the lower levels. It’s going to be tight, but we have a good shot if we move quickly.”

As they moved deeper into the prison. The faint sounds of guards patrolling could be heard down the hall, and every corner they passed could hide an enemy. But for now, they remained undetected, slipping through the shadows as Mercer led them deeper into the facility.

But as they neared their destination, a sudden problem arose. A pair of guards appeared in the hallway ahead. The group froze, their bodies tensing as they tried to find a way to remain undetected.

Mercer held up his hand, signaling them to stop. His eyes scanned the surroundings quickly. &quot;We need a way out, now. If we don’t move fast enough, we’ll get spotted. But we can’t let that happen.&quot;

[[ Straight Ahead   ]]
[[ Ventilation Shaft    ]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="203" name="The Broken Crown   " tags="" position="1175,6725" size="100,100">The broken, scattered pieces of conversations and the distant voices reverberated off the walls of the crowded hallway. The activity here was unlike any Rowan had encountered before, it felt like a hive of purpose, alive with intention. 

Vale paused before a heavy door, its surface scratched and worn, the handle worn smooth by countless hands. He turned to Rowan, giving a reassuring nod. “This is it,” he said simply.

The door groaned as it slid open, revealing a room that could have once been a grand hall or a meeting space. Now, it was a controlled chaos, with broken furniture and makeshift tables scattered throughout the space. People moved between them, some sitting, others standing. Weapons, tools, and bits of technology littered the space. 

The room stilled as they entered, eyes lifting from whatever task or conversation they had been involved in. Rowan’s eyes scanned the faces before him. Some were hard, battle-worn, others youthful and full of hunger for something greater. Each person seemed to have a different type of intensity.

Vale stepped forward, and as he did, the crowd seemed to part, like a sea shifting to make way for something powerful. The leader of The Broken Crowns stood at the far end of the room, his back to them. He was tall, broad-shouldered, with a hardened face that had seen more than its fair share of battles. His clothing was practical, tactical even, layered with bits of worn armor and accessories that gave him an air of someone who’d seen the world from the outside and came back to claim his place. 

&quot;Rowan, meet the leader of The Broken Crowns,&quot; Vale spoke in a low tone. 

The leader turned, his eyes sharp, assessing Rowan with a brief but thorough glance. He didn’t smile or offer pleasantries; his demeanor was no-nonsense, as though time was something he had little to spare. Yet there was an undeniable sense of respect.

“Welcome to our home, Rowan,” the leader said, his voice deep and calm. “I am known as Talon, the leader of The Broken Crowns. We’re a faction of the overlooked, the discarded, those left behind by the Federation and its chokehold on this world. And you, Rowan, you’ve made a wise choice in seeking us out. Few have the courage to stand against the tide.”

Rowan could tell that Talon was sizing him up, just as he had with Vale. There was no judgment in his eyes, as if he were trying to determine whether Rowan was the ally he needed or just another passing face in a crowd.

“Thank you,” Rowan said. “I’m here to find a path that aligns with my goals. If you think I’m wise, then we’ll see if we can work together.”

Talon gave a slight nod, his face twitching in what could almost have been a smirk. “We don’t offer anyone salvation. You’ll have to carve your own way here. But you’ve chosen right. The Broken Crowns are not just a band of rebels, we’re a force of freedom.”

The leader stepped closer, his eyes narrowing as he studied Rowan. “Tell me, Rowan, do you have any experience with weapons? We fight battles where the gun in your hand is as important as the strength in your heart. Not every weapon is a sword or a blade. Some are designed to protect the power structures of the Federation.”

Rowan’s expression hardened. “I know my way around a weapon. You can say I’ve been trained.”

Talon’s expression softened just a touch, a feeling of approval crossing his features. “Good. Very good. But I hope you’re ready to handle more than just standard issue. These days, a man needs to be prepared for anything, and in our ranks, we need those who can handle more than just the typical.”

He motioned to a table near the back of the room, where several high-tech firearms lay scattered. “We have pulse rifles here, Federal ones, designed with biolocks embedded in their algorithms. No one outside the Federation could ever dream of unlocking them. They’re useless unless you’ve been specifically authorized by their DNA protocols. But you’re a wise one, I imagine you’ve thought about that, haven’t you?”

Rowan’s brow furrowed. He stepped closer to the table, his fingers grazing the sleek surface of the rifles. They were impressive, no doubt, but it was the lock in their systems that concerned him. “Once again, I know,” he said, eyes fixed on Talon. “But... how could anyone use them if they’re biolocked? You need to be coded, have the Federation’s DNA signatures to even fire them.”

Talon chuckled, a low, throaty sound that went around in the quiet room. “Ah, the biolock. The Federation’s most foolproof method of ensuring their weapons only work for their own. They think they’ve cornered the market, don’t they?”

He took a step toward Rowan, his eyes glinting with a dangerous knowledge. “We have our ways. The Broken Crowns have no shortage of data jackers, skilled technicians who can rewrite, rework, and unlock just about anything. Federal firearms are no exception. These aren’t just toys, Rowan. They’re tools, weapons designed to hold their own against the might of the Federation. We’ve got some of the best in the business, and they know how to force-unlock those weapons. Trust me when I say... it’s a great weapon to wield.”

Rowan nodded slowly, his eyes drifting back to the rifles. It was clear Talon wasn’t just speaking in hypotheticals. This was the reality of their operation. “So, you’ve got people who can hack into the Federation’s system? They can unlock these things and make them usable for anyone?” he asked, intrigued but still cautious.

Talon’s lips curled into a smile, though it was more like a snarl. “Not just anyone. But if you’re in our ranks, you’ll be ready to use them. And that’s what counts. You’ll see for yourself soon enough.”

Rowan could feel the decision pressing down on him as he looked from Talon to the pulse rifles on the table. This was the kind of weaponry he needed to survive in a world where control was everything, where the Federation held all the cards. And now, with The Broken Crowns, it seemed he might have a chance to tip the scales.

“I’m in,” Rowan said, his voice firm. “If you can unlock these weapons, then I’ll fight with you. Let’s see what kind of force we can become.”

Talon’s eyes sparkled with approval, and for the first time, his expression softened. “Welcome to The Broken Crowns, Rowan. You’ve chosen well.”

Talon leaned back slightly, his hands behind his back as he observed Rowan closely. The room seemed to tighten in anticipation of what was to come.

“There’s something I need you to do, Rowan,” he said, the edges of his words heavy with meaning. “A test of sorts. A way for you to prove you’re worthy of our cause.”

Rowan straightened, his eyes narrowing slightly as he studied Talon. The leader’s demeanor hadn’t changed; there was no sign of trickery, but there was no mistaking the fact that this task would be crucial.

“The factions like to band together to help each other reach their goals, but remember, Rowan, our ideals still differ in the end. One of us will have to take the throne of the Federation if we ever make it to the end of this war. But that’s a distant thought for now. Right now, it’s about proving loyalty to your people, your ideals. You’re going to do something that will set you apart.”

Rowan’s jaw clenched slightly. “What’s the job?”

Talon continued. “There’s a Broken Crown officer, one of ours, who’s been captured by the Federation. We know where he’s being held, but the detention facility is well-guarded. This isn’t a simple rescue mission, Rowan. You’ll need to be quick, decisive, and ruthless when necessary. We need him back, and I trust you can do it.”

Rowan paused, his mind working quickly. He didn’t hesitate for long. “I can do it. I know a guy who’d be perfect for this kind of job.”

Talon gave a slight nod of approval, his eyes filled with satisfaction. “Good. You’ll need all the help you can get. I’ll lend you a unit of men who know this mission well. It’s important to me that we gain an edge over the Federation, and this officer is crucial to our cause.”

“I agree,” Rowan said, his voice firm and clear. “I’ll get the job done.”

Talon nodded again, then gestured to the soldiers in the room. A sergeant stepped forward, his demeanor calm but alert. He was a tall, broad man with a hardened face, eyes that had seen the worst of the world and lived to tell about it.

The sergeant spoke first, his voice a low rumble. “I’ll be delighted to show you the way, Rowan. My name’s Mercer, and I know this mission inside and out.” He paused, sizing Rowan up for a moment before continuing. “If you’re up for it, I’ll make sure we get in, get the officer, and get out with minimal hassle.”

Rowan gave a small nod. “I appreciate it, Mercer.”

As the sergeant made his preparations, Rowan had went out of his way to find the man he wanted to bring, he turned to Kade, the familiar figure he had met in the infirmary. Kade was sitting near the back, checking over his gear. When Rowan’s eyes found him, Kade’s head snapped up. Recognition was in his eyes, followed by a knowing smile.

“Hey, Kade,” Rowan called, his voice steady. “You want to join us on a search-and-rescue mission?”

Kade grinned, standing up to join Rowan. “Hell yeah, I’m in. The Broken Crowns could use an engineer. I’m your man.”

Rowan could already sense that Kade’s skills would be invaluable. As a former Federal engineer, Kade was uniquely qualified to help them navigate the more technical aspects of their mission. Together, they would form a strong team, one that could handle both combat and the intricacies of the Federation’s security systems.

With everything set, the team made their way out to the VTOL waiting outside. The sky was dark, with clouds drifting lazily across the horizon. The VTOL’s engines was soft in the night air as the team boarded. The sleek, black vehicle was built for stealth, designed to blend in with the darkness and avoid detection. Its engines whined as it took off, lifting the group into the night sky and heading toward their destination.

The trip was mostly silent, save for the occasional exchange of words between the team. Mercer was focused on the mission. Rowan and Kade sat together, going over the details of the mission. Rowan explained the situation to Kade, who nodded along, already brainstorming ways to get past the Federation’s security systems.

“The Federation won’t make this easy,” Kade said, adjusting his gear. “But I’ll be able to work with whatever you throw at me. I’ve dealt with worse.”

Mercer’s voice broke through their conversation. “We’re getting close. The detention facility’s not far now.”

The VTOL descended gradually, avoiding the Federation’s radar systems by skimming low through the clouds. It touched down in a secluded area, between several mountains, its engines powering down as they landed in a small, hidden clearing. The landing zone was safe for now, but they would need to be careful.

As the team disembarked, Mercer led them through the dense underbrush. Rowan took in the surroundings as they moved, the dense forest around them adding to the sense of isolation. After a few minutes, Mercer spoke again, his voice low.

“Not far now. We’ll get close enough to make a final approach on foot.”

Rowan nodded, keeping his eyes sharp. “Who else is in your unit? Who are we working with?”

Mercer glanced back, his eyes reflecting the light from the surrounding trees. “We’ve got a recon specialist with us. He’ll be handling any engagements from a distance, sniper support, surveillance, and the like. He’s good, Rowan. You’ll want him on your side.”

Rowan raised an eyebrow. “What else?”

Mercer kept walking, his pace unbroken. “We’ve got a couple of other specialists, too. A demolitions expert, a tech officer, and a medic. Everyone’s here for a reason. We’ve trained together for this kind of mission. Now we just need to stick to the plan.”

The group continued forward, walking through the dense woods with Mercer leading them expertly through the terrain. Rowan glanced over at Kade.

“We’ll be good,” Rowan said. “Kade’s a Federal engineer. He’ll be able to hack into their systems if need be.”

Kade gave a small grin. “That’s the plan. But I’m not the only one with tricks up my sleeve.”

As the group made their way closer to the facility. they could see the lights of the detention facility in the distance. It was a massive structure, built to contain high-value prisoners, a fortress surrounded by high walls and guarded by Federation soldiers. The sight of it sent a shiver down Rowan’s spine. It was a place where escape was nearly impossible, and survival even harder.

The facility itself was complex, a series of high-tech buildings surrounded by electrified fences and heavy security. Watchtowers lined the perimeter, their red lights scanning the area for any signs of movement. Military soldiers patrolled the outer edges, their rifles scanning the terrain actively. Rowan’s eyes caught glimpses of the sentries on the walls, their patrols moving methodically, but they were still far enough away for them to make their move.

Mercer’s voice was a whisper in the dark. “We’ll need to approach from the west. There’s a blind spot in their security, and we can use it to slip inside. Once we’re in, we’ll have to move fast. No hesitation.”

Rowan nodded, his mind already running through the plan. “Let’s do it.”

The team moved through the forest. Mercer, the sergeant, led the way, as he led Rowan and Kade toward the west side of the detention facility. The dense underbrush and towering trees provided some cover, but the path ahead was still fraught with danger. Rowan stayed alert, his mind running through the possible scenarios in his head as they approached their destination.

Soon, they reached the designated recon point, a small rise that overlooked the perimeter of the facility. The recon specialist, was already in place, his long-range sniper rifle set up on a tripod and aimed at the facility. His eyes were locked on the movement of the guards below, monitoring their patrol routes. His presence was ghostlike, blending seamlessly into the night.

Mercer spoke low, his voice steady. &quot;Recon, what&#39;s the layout? We need to move in.&quot;

He barely moved, his eyes scanning the area through his binoculars. &quot;Two guards on each tower, two squads on the ground. Standard patrol routes. The security systems are tight, electrified fences, cameras on every corner. But there’s a gap to the west, a maintenance tunnel beneath the old wall. We can slip through there, but it&#39;s going to be a tight squeeze.&quot;

Rowan studied the area, his mind already mapping out the route. &quot;What about the fence? The alarms on it?&quot;

He looked down at his equipment, tapping his screen. &quot;The fence has a control box nearby, looks like a manual override for the alarms. We’ll need to disable it before crossing.&quot;

Kade spoke up, his voice calm but with a hint of excitement. &quot;I can handle that. I’ve worked with this tech before. Shouldn’t be a problem.&quot;

Mercer nodded, stepping aside. &quot;Good. Take the lead, Kade. We’re counting on you.&quot;

Kade gave a small grin and moved forward, checking his tools and his gear as they advanced. Rowan stayed close, his eyes darting between Kade and the patrolling guards. They had to stay low, and the slightest misstep could mean disaster.

As they approached the maintenance tunnel, Kade was already at work. He crouched down beside a set of exposed wires near the fence, his hands moving swiftly over the control panel. His eyes flicked back to Rowan. &quot;This is it. I’m shutting off the fence alarms. But listen,&quot; he added in a hushed tone, &quot;the Federation soldiers are all equipped with bio-sensors. If one of them flatlines, the alarms will go off, and they’ll be on us in seconds.&quot;

Rowan nodded. &quot;Understood.&quot;

The seconds stretched out as Kade worked quickly, his hands flying over the control panel. A soft click went through the silence as the alarms on the fence went quiet, signaling that they could move.

Mercer whispered, &quot;Move.&quot;

They slipped through the hole Kade had created, crawling beneath the electrified fence and into the cramped maintenance tunnel. The air was musty, stale from years of disuse, but it provided the cover they needed. They moved quickly, following Mercer’s lead as he navigated the dark, narrow passage.

As they moved deeper into the tunnel, the walls seemed to close in, the tightness of the space adding to the sense of urgency. 

Soon, they reached a set of rusted doors that led into the prison complex. Kade reached for the control panel beside the door, his fingers moving with ease as he attempted to hack into the system. A low buzz sounded, then a click. The door slid open, revealing a dimly lit corridor on the other side. The walls were lined with reinforced doors, the prison’s inner sanctum.

Mercer signaled for them to move forward. “We’ve got to move fast. The officer is being held in the lower levels. It’s going to be tight, but we have a good shot if we move quickly.”

As they moved deeper into the prison. The faint sounds of guards patrolling could be heard down the hall, and every corner they passed could hide an enemy. But for now, they remained undetected, slipping through the shadows as Mercer led them deeper into the facility.

But as they neared their destination, a sudden problem arose. A pair of guards appeared in the hallway ahead. The group froze, their bodies tensing as they tried to find a way to remain undetected.

Mercer held up his hand, signaling them to stop. His eyes scanned the surroundings quickly. &quot;We need a way out, now. If we don’t move fast enough, we’ll get spotted. But we can’t let that happen.&quot;

    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rowan leads the team straight ahead, ignoring the flashing &quot;Restricted Zone&quot; signs at the security checkpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Just as he approachs the gates, a sharp *beep-beep-beep* could be heard. The alarms screech to life, crimson lights spinning wildly overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh no, oh no, oh no,&quot; someone mutters under their breath as automated turrets begin coming to life, swiveling in his direction. Rowan&#39;s voice breaks through the chaos, &quot;Fall back! We’re screwed!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;But it’s too late. The heavy thud of boots signals the arrival of federal military personnel. Dozens pour into the corridor, weapons drawn, their bio-enhanced visors locking onto them instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Freeze!&quot; one of the soldiers yells, but no one has time to react. The first shot is fired, and all hell breaks loose. Bullets and pulse rounds rip through the air, leaving no room for survival.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The team is systematically wiped out. Rowan tries to return fire, but a well-placed shot takes him down before he can even aim.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Within moments, the corridor is silent again.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The world goes black instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="205" name=" Ventilation Shaft  " tags="" position="1100,6875" size="100,100">The squad went forward through the ventilation system. The confined space amplified the subtle scrape of their gear and the occasional creak of the metal beneath them. Rowan led the way, looking out for potential obstacles while Kade monitored their position on a compact schematic displayed on his wrist tablet.  

After navigating through several turns and drops, they found an opening that overlooked a dimly lit staff room. Below, a massive industrial fan dominated one wall, its blades spinning lazily as it cycled cool air throughout the facility.  

Rowan signaled for a stop and gestured for Kade to move forward. The engineer crawled beside him and peered through the grate. &quot;That fan leads to the room where the officer is being held,&quot; Kade whispered. &quot;It’s our way in.&quot;  

&quot;Can you disable it without tripping the system?&quot; Rowan asked, his voice barely audible.  
Kade smirked, pulling out a compact toolkit. &quot;Do you even need to ask?&quot;  

As Kade worked on loosening the grate, Mercer and Tessa took up defensive positions, watching the narrow vent for any sign of pursuit. Just as Kade finished removing the final bolt, Mercer froze. He raised a fist, a universal signal to halt. Everyone immediately went still.  

From below, the sound of heavy boots went through the room. The squad peered through the slats of the grate as the door swung open, revealing three massive figures.  
(text-colour:red)[Elite Honor Guards.  ]

The guards strode into the room. Their crimson cloaks swayed as they walked, the polished surface of their monotech goggles reflecting the dim light. Each one stood nearly eight feet tall. The leader of the trio carried an unsettling weapon at his side, a hilt that pulsed faintly with crimson light.  

Rowan tensed as the guards approached the Broken Crown Officer, who sat shackled to a heavy chair in the center of the room. Despite his injuries, the officer held his head high, his defiance undimmed.  

The lead Honor Guard’s voice was a low, mechanical growl as he spoke. &quot;We’ll ask one more time: What are your group’s intentions against High Command?&quot;  

The officer sneered, blood dripping from a cut on his lip. &quot;Go to hell.&quot;  

One of the guards stepped forward, the weapon at his side activating with a menacing snap-hiss. A crimson, unstable blade burst to life, its jagged edges crackling with raw energy. The guard brought it dangerously close to the officer’s face, the heat of the blade causing beads of sweat to form on the officer’s forehead.  

&quot;Talk,&quot; the guard demanded, his voice laced with menace. &quot;What do you know about the Federation’s defenses? What’s your plan?&quot;  

Rowan glanced at Mercer, who had already drawn his silenced weapon. A single nod from Rowan was all the confirmation Mercer needed.  

Kade leaned close to Rowan and whispered, &quot;The fan’s ready, but we’ve got to move fast.&quot;  

&quot;Stay here and hold the vent for us,&quot; Rowan ordered. &quot;We’ll need you to deploy the ladder when it’s time to exfil.&quot;  

Rowan signaled to the squad, and one by one, they silently descended into the staff room, using the now-stationary fan as their entry point.  

The first guard barely had time to register the faint shuffle of footsteps before Rowan’s blade pierced through the gap between his helmet and chest armor. The massive figure collapsed with a heavy thud. 

The second guard turned, raising his weapon, but Mercer’s silenced shot struck him squarely in the visor, shattering the monotech goggles and dropping him instantly.  

The third guard roared in rage, igniting his lightsaber as he lunged at Rowan. The unstable blade hissed and crackled, narrowly missing its mark. Rowan ducked beneath the swing and retaliated with a precise upward slash, his blade finding the vulnerable joint beneath the guard’s arm. The giant staggered, and Mercer delivered the final blow, her combat knife driving into the base of his skull.  

The room fell silent save for the faint hum of the deactivated lightsaber.  

Mercer nudged one of the fallen guards with his boot, his brow furrowed. &quot;That was too easy,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Elite Honor Guards are supposed to put up more of a fight.&quot;  

Before Rowan could respond, the shrill wail of an alarm pierced the air, bathing the room in a pulsating red light.  

&quot;Time’s up!&quot; Kade shouted from above. &quot;We’ve got company, move!&quot;  

The squad acted quickly, freeing the Broken Crown Officer from his restraints. The man was weak, but he managed to stand with their support.  

&quot;Up the ladder, now!&quot; Rowan barked, shoving the officer toward the deployable ladder Kade had lowered into the room.  

One by one, the squad climbed back into the ventilation shaft, Kade pulling up the ladder the moment everyone was aboard. He quickly reattached the fan, its blades whirring back to life just as the sound of boots thundered into the staff room below.  

From their hidden vantage point, Rowan watched as a squad of federal soldiers stormed into the room, their weapons drawn. They froze at the sight of the three dead Honor Guards.  

&quot;Targets are gone,&quot; one of the soldiers reported, his voice tense. &quot;The Honor Guards... they’re down. Repeat, they’re tagged as dead!&quot;  

Another soldier began giving orders into a comm unit, but it was too late. Rowan and his team were already deep in the ventilation system, heading toward their extraction point. 

&quot;That was cutting it close,&quot; Mercer muttered as he crawled ahead.  

Rowan glanced at Kade, who was securing the rear. &quot;Good work back there,&quot; Rowan said. &quot;We owe you.&quot;  

Kade wiped sweat from his brow and gave a tired grin. &quot;Just another day on the job.&quot;  

The squad went on, the distant alarms fading behind them as they disappeared into the vents, their mission far from over.  

With the Broken Crown Officer secured and the fan blades spinning once again, the squad moved swiftly back into the ventilation system. Drowned out by the blaring alarms going through the base. Red emergency lights pulsing in synchrony, casting shadows through the vents and grates. 

“Kade, how far?” Rowan whispered sharply.  

“Two more turns, then straight to the exit,” Kade replied, his eyes glued to the schematic displayed on his wrist tablet. Sweat dripped from his brow as he crawled ahead.  

Mercer helped the officer along, the man limping but still determined to escape. The officer’s breathing was labored, his face pale, but he said nothing, pushing himself to keep up.

Mercer activated his comm softly. “Recon, status?”  

“Perimeter’s swarming,” Recon replied in his usual calm tone. “Looks like they’re doing a sweep of the forest edge. I’ve taken out a few already. No chatter yet, seems they haven’t realized their comms are dead.”  

“Keep it that way,” Rowan interjected, his tone firm. “We can’t afford them calling for reinforcements here.”  

From his elevated vantage point outside the compound, Recon adjusted his scope. The digital display of his rifle overlaid critical information as he scanned the area. A group of guards patrolling near the main gate came into view. One guard paused, looking in the direction of the forest.  

Recon exhaled slowly, steadying his aim. The suppressor muffled the crack of his rifle as the first guard dropped silently, a clean shot through the neck. The second guard turned, his expression frozen in surprise, just as another shot found its hit.  

“Two down.” Recon murmured. “Keep moving. I’ll handle anyone who gets too close.”  

Inside the vent, the squad reached the final stretch leading to their entry point. The faint glow of moonlight spilled through the grate.  

“Kade, get that panel open,” Mercer ordered.  

Kade moved quickly, pulling out a compact tool to unscrew the bolts holding the grate in place. With a soft creak, it came loose, and he set it aside carefully.  

“Let’s go,” Rowan said, gesturing for Mercer and the officer to move first.  

The squad emerged into the open air, crouching low as they used the surrounding shadows for cover. The forest was ahead.  

“Recon, eyes up,” Rowan said.  

“Already on it,” Recon replied. He scanned the area again, spotting a pair of guards near a communications dish. One of them reached for his radio, likely to report in they found the team running away.  

&#39;&#39;Not happening.  &#39;&#39;

Recon adjusted his scope and fired, the first shot dropping the guard instantly. The second guard froze, looking around frantically before falling moments later.  

“Clear,” Recon confirmed. “You’re good to move. Stay low.”  

Mercer led the group into the forest, the dense canopy swallowing them in darkness. The officer stumbled once, but Mercer caught him, supporting him with an arm around his shoulders.  

The alarms from the base faded as they ventured deeper into the woods. The only sounds now were the rustling of leaves underfoot and the occasional distant call of wildlife.  

After what felt like hours, they reached the extraction point. The VTOL was already waiting, its engines sounding softly as its faint lights illuminated the clearing.  

“Move, move,” Mercer urged, helping the officer climb aboard.  

Rowan and Kade kept watch, their weapons focused on the treeline until everyone was safely inside. With a sharp hiss, the VTOL’s doors slid shut, and the craft lifted off, its engines roaring to life as it ascended into the night sky.  

Rowan exhaled deeply, leaning against the bulkhead as the adrenaline began to wear off. The officer, seated across from him, looked up with tired but grateful eyes.  

“Thank you,” the officer said, his voice heavy with emotion. “If you hadn’t come, I wouldn’t have lasted another day in there. I’ve been gathering intel for weeks... This is going to change everything.”  

Rowan managed a faint smile, nodding. “Glad we could help.”  

The VTOL soared over the forest, the lights of the enemy base growing faint in the distance. Inside, the squad allowed themselves a moment to decompress. Mercer checked his weapon, Tessa leaned back with her eyes closed, and Kade wiped sweat from his brow, glancing at the officer with a nod of respect.  

They landed at the Broken Crown outpost an hour later. As the VTOL’s doors slid open, the squad disembarked, guiding the officer toward the bunker where Talon waited.  

Talon stood at the entrance, his arms crossed, his imposing figure silhouetted against the dim light of the bunker.  

“Well done,” Talon said, stepping forward. “You brought him back intact, and you managed to avoid a full-scale firefight. Impressive.”  

The officer nodded, pulling a data chip from his pocket. “Everything you need is here, movement plans, defense layouts, even details on their communication protocols. With this, you’ll have the upper hand.”  

Talon took the chip, his expression unreadable as he inspected it. Finally, he turned to Rowan.

“You’ve proven yourself out there,” Talon said. “You’ve got the skill, the composure, and the leadership we need. I’m officially welcoming you to the Broken Crowns.”  

Rowan blinked in surprise but nodded. “Thank you, sir.”  

“Get some rest,” Talon continued, placing a hand on Rowan’s shoulder. “Tomorrow, we begin our assault on the Citadel. This is our moment to strike. Be ready.”  

“Yes, sir,” Rowan replied, his voice steady.  

Rowan made his way to the dormitory section of the bunker. His body felt heavy with exhaustion, his muscles aching from the night’s events. As he reached his bunk, he sat down, running a hand through his hair.  

The dim light above flickered faintly as he lay back, staring at the ceiling. His mind raced with thoughts of the mission ahead, the officer’s intel, and what it would mean for their fight against the Federation. But as his eyes closed, the weight of fatigue overtook him, and sleep came swiftly.

    &lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rowan leads the team straight ahead, ignoring the flashing &quot;Restricted Zone&quot; signs at the security checkpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Just as he approachs the gates, a sharp *beep-beep-beep* could be heard. The alarms screech to life, crimson lights spinning wildly overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh no, oh no, oh no,&quot; someone mutters under their breath as automated turrets begin coming to life, swiveling in his direction. Rowan&#39;s voice breaks through the chaos, &quot;Fall back! We’re screwed!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;But it’s too late. The heavy thud of boots signals the arrival of federal military personnel. Dozens pour into the corridor, weapons drawn, their bio-enhanced visors locking onto them instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Freeze!&quot; one of the soldiers yells, but no one has time to react. The first shot is fired, and all hell breaks loose. Bullets and pulse rounds rip through the air, leaving no room for survival.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The team is systematically wiped out. Rowan tries to return fire, but a well-placed shot takes him down before he can even aim.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Within moments, the corridor is silent again.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The world goes black instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="207" name=" Ventilation Shaft    " tags="" position="1350,6850" size="100,100">The squad went forward through the ventilation system. The confined space amplified the subtle scrape of their gear and the occasional creak of the metal beneath them. Rowan led the way, looking out for potential obstacles while Kade monitored their position on a compact schematic displayed on his wrist tablet.  

After navigating through several turns and drops, they found an opening that overlooked a dimly lit staff room. Below, a massive industrial fan dominated one wall, its blades spinning lazily as it cycled cool air throughout the facility.  

Rowan signaled for a stop and gestured for Kade to move forward. The engineer crawled beside him and peered through the grate. &quot;That fan leads to the room where the officer is being held,&quot; Kade whispered. &quot;It’s our way in.&quot;  

&quot;Can you disable it without tripping the system?&quot; Rowan asked, his voice barely audible.  
Kade smirked, pulling out a compact toolkit. &quot;Do you even need to ask?&quot;  

As Kade worked on loosening the grate, Mercer and Tessa took up defensive positions, watching the narrow vent for any sign of pursuit. Just as Kade finished removing the final bolt, Mercer froze. He raised a fist, a universal signal to halt. Everyone immediately went still.  

From below, the sound of heavy boots went through the room. The squad peered through the slats of the grate as the door swung open, revealing three massive figures.  
(text-colour:red)[Elite Honor Guards.  ]

The guards strode into the room. Their crimson cloaks swayed as they walked, the polished surface of their monotech goggles reflecting the dim light. Each one stood nearly eight feet tall. The leader of the trio carried an unsettling weapon at his side, a hilt that pulsed faintly with crimson light.  

Rowan tensed as the guards approached the Broken Crown Officer, who sat shackled to a heavy chair in the center of the room. Despite his injuries, the officer held his head high, his defiance undimmed.  

The lead Honor Guard’s voice was a low, mechanical growl as he spoke. &quot;We’ll ask one more time: What are your group’s intentions against High Command?&quot;  

The officer sneered, blood dripping from a cut on his lip. &quot;Go to hell.&quot;  

One of the guards stepped forward, the weapon at his side activating with a menacing snap-hiss. A crimson, unstable blade burst to life, its jagged edges crackling with raw energy. The guard brought it dangerously close to the officer’s face, the heat of the blade causing beads of sweat to form on the officer’s forehead.  

&quot;Talk,&quot; the guard demanded, his voice laced with menace. &quot;What do you know about the Federation’s defenses? What’s your plan?&quot;  

Rowan glanced at Mercer, who had already drawn his silenced weapon. A single nod from Rowan was all the confirmation Mercer needed.  

Kade leaned close to Rowan and whispered, &quot;The fan’s ready, but we’ve got to move fast.&quot;  

&quot;Stay here and hold the vent for us,&quot; Rowan ordered. &quot;We’ll need you to deploy the ladder when it’s time to exfil.&quot;  

Rowan signaled to the squad, and one by one, they silently descended into the staff room, using the now-stationary fan as their entry point.  

The first guard barely had time to register the faint shuffle of footsteps before Rowan’s blade pierced through the gap between his helmet and chest armor. The massive figure collapsed with a heavy thud. 

The second guard turned, raising his weapon, but Mercer’s silenced shot struck him squarely in the visor, shattering the monotech goggles and dropping him instantly.  

The third guard roared in rage, igniting his lightsaber as he lunged at Rowan. The unstable blade hissed and crackled, narrowly missing its mark. Rowan ducked beneath the swing and retaliated with a precise upward slash, his blade finding the vulnerable joint beneath the guard’s arm. The giant staggered, and Mercer delivered the final blow, her combat knife driving into the base of his skull.  

The room fell silent save for the faint hum of the deactivated lightsaber.  

Mercer nudged one of the fallen guards with his boot, his brow furrowed. &quot;That was too easy,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Elite Honor Guards are supposed to put up more of a fight.&quot;  

Before Rowan could respond, the shrill wail of an alarm pierced the air, bathing the room in a pulsating red light.  

&quot;Time’s up!&quot; Kade shouted from above. &quot;We’ve got company, move!&quot;  

The squad acted quickly, freeing the Broken Crown Officer from his restraints. The man was weak, but he managed to stand with their support.  

&quot;Up the ladder, now!&quot; Rowan barked, shoving the officer toward the deployable ladder Kade had lowered into the room.  

One by one, the squad climbed back into the ventilation shaft, Kade pulling up the ladder the moment everyone was aboard. He quickly reattached the fan, its blades whirring back to life just as the sound of boots thundered into the staff room below.  

From their hidden vantage point, Rowan watched as a squad of federal soldiers stormed into the room, their weapons drawn. They froze at the sight of the three dead Honor Guards.  

&quot;Targets are gone,&quot; one of the soldiers reported, his voice tense. &quot;The Honor Guards... they’re down. Repeat, they’re tagged as dead!&quot;  

Another soldier began giving orders into a comm unit, but it was too late. Rowan and his team were already deep in the ventilation system, heading toward their extraction point. 

&quot;That was cutting it close,&quot; Mercer muttered as he crawled ahead.  

Rowan glanced at Kade, who was securing the rear. &quot;Good work back there,&quot; Rowan said. &quot;We owe you.&quot;  

Kade wiped sweat from his brow and gave a tired grin. &quot;Just another day on the job.&quot;  

The squad went on, the distant alarms fading behind them as they disappeared into the vents, their mission far from over.  

With the Broken Crown Officer secured and the fan blades spinning once again, the squad moved swiftly back into the ventilation system. Drowned out by the blaring alarms going through the base. Red emergency lights pulsing in synchrony, casting shadows through the vents and grates. 

“Kade, how far?” Rowan whispered sharply.  

“Two more turns, then straight to the exit,” Kade replied, his eyes glued to the schematic displayed on his wrist tablet. Sweat dripped from his brow as he crawled ahead.  

Mercer helped the officer along, the man limping but still determined to escape. The officer’s breathing was labored, his face pale, but he said nothing, pushing himself to keep up.

Mercer activated his comm softly. “Recon, status?”  

“Perimeter’s swarming,” Recon replied in his usual calm tone. “Looks like they’re doing a sweep of the forest edge. I’ve taken out a few already. No chatter yet, seems they haven’t realized their comms are dead.”  

“Keep it that way,” Rowan interjected, his tone firm. “We can’t afford them calling for reinforcements here.”  

From his elevated vantage point outside the compound, Recon adjusted his scope. The digital display of his rifle overlaid critical information as he scanned the area. A group of guards patrolling near the main gate came into view. One guard paused, looking in the direction of the forest.  

Recon exhaled slowly, steadying his aim. The suppressor muffled the crack of his rifle as the first guard dropped silently, a clean shot through the neck. The second guard turned, his expression frozen in surprise, just as another shot found its hit.  

“Two down.” Recon murmured. “Keep moving. I’ll handle anyone who gets too close.”  

Inside the vent, the squad reached the final stretch leading to their entry point. The faint glow of moonlight spilled through the grate.  

“Kade, get that panel open,” Mercer ordered.  

Kade moved quickly, pulling out a compact tool to unscrew the bolts holding the grate in place. With a soft creak, it came loose, and he set it aside carefully.  

“Let’s go,” Rowan said, gesturing for Mercer and the officer to move first.  

The squad emerged into the open air, crouching low as they used the surrounding shadows for cover. The forest was ahead.  

“Recon, eyes up,” Rowan said.  

“Already on it,” Recon replied. He scanned the area again, spotting a pair of guards near a communications dish. One of them reached for his radio, likely to report in they found the team running away.  

&#39;&#39;Not happening.  &#39;&#39;

Recon adjusted his scope and fired, the first shot dropping the guard instantly. The second guard froze, looking around frantically before falling moments later.  

“Clear,” Recon confirmed. “You’re good to move. Stay low.”  

Mercer led the group into the forest, the dense canopy swallowing them in darkness. The officer stumbled once, but Mercer caught him, supporting him with an arm around his shoulders.  

The alarms from the base faded as they ventured deeper into the woods. The only sounds now were the rustling of leaves underfoot and the occasional distant call of wildlife.  

After what felt like hours, they reached the extraction point. The VTOL was already waiting, its engines sounding softly as its faint lights illuminated the clearing.  

“Move, move,” Mercer urged, helping the officer climb aboard.  

Rowan and Kade kept watch, their weapons focused on the treeline until everyone was safely inside. With a sharp hiss, the VTOL’s doors slid shut, and the craft lifted off, its engines roaring to life as it ascended into the night sky.  

Rowan exhaled deeply, leaning against the bulkhead as the adrenaline began to wear off. The officer, seated across from him, looked up with tired but grateful eyes.  

“Thank you,” the officer said, his voice heavy with emotion. “If you hadn’t come, I wouldn’t have lasted another day in there. I’ve been gathering intel for weeks... This is going to change everything.”  

Rowan managed a faint smile, nodding. “Glad we could help.”  

The VTOL soared over the forest, the lights of the enemy base growing faint in the distance. Inside, the squad allowed themselves a moment to decompress. Mercer checked his weapon, Tessa leaned back with her eyes closed, and Kade wiped sweat from his brow, glancing at the officer with a nod of respect.

The dream was still fresh in his mind, as though it had painted a different version of reality, a vision of peace and self-worth that felt impossible to grasp in the harsh world around him. His eyes opened slowly, the weight of the mission ahead pulling him back into the present.

Kade stepped inside. His face was hard, eyes cold. “Get up,” Kade’s voice was firm. “Talon’s waiting for everyone at the rally point. Move it.”

Rowan sat up, shaking off the remnants of his dream. He quickly threw on his gear and followed Kade through the winding halls of the underground bunker. They moved quickly as they entered the main briefing area where Talon was already gathered with the rest of the team.

Talon stood at the front of the room. “You’re all here,” Talon said, his voice low but firm. “This is it. Time to hit the Citadel. We’re moving out, now.”

Everyone loaded up quickly, their movements fluid and practiced. VTOLs were prepped and waiting on the tarmac outside the bunker, their engines humming with the promise of the coming storm. The squad filed into their respective vehicles, Rowan taking a seat near the back of the VTOL, his thoughts racing as they lifted off into the early morning sky. 

The journey was tense. Outside the windows, the world rushed by as the squad headed toward Ontario airspace. Rowan tried to focus, but his mind kept drifting back to the dream, an elusive hope. 

It didn’t take long for that illusion to shatter.

Suddenly, the calm was broken by a deafening crack from the outside, followed by a series of explosive impacts. The VTOL shook violently, its engines sputtering as the whole aircraft rocked mid-air. The airspace was filled with tracer rounds, and the distant thud of exploding shells around them. 

The VTOL was struck, sending the entire vehicle spiraling out of control. Rowan’s seatbelt locked in place, but the force of the explosion sent him flying, slamming into the side of the craft. His vision blurred from the impact, the sudden chaos rendering him disoriented. He felt the ground tilt beneath him as the aircraft spiraled into freefall. The familiar sound of a battle outside was drowned out by the violent, metallic scream of the VTOL’s systems failing.

He barely managed to unbuckle himself before the VTOL crashed violently into the ground. Rowan tumbled from the wreckage, bruised but alive. His helmet was cracked, blood running down the side of his face from a cut near his temple, but it was nothing compared to the others.

The battlefield outside was already a storm of gunfire, smoke, and destruction. The team’s VTOLs were scattered, most shot down before they even had a chance to reach the target zone. Rowan could barely make sense of the area, the sharp cracks of gunfire ringing out from all directions.

The assault was already falling apart. The mission had barely begun, and it seemed as if their chances of success were evaporating like the morning mist. Rowan knew he had to move fast. He needed to get out of the open and find shelter, or he would be a sitting target.

His instincts kicked in. He ducked low, rolling out of the wreckage as another explosion erupted nearby, sending debris flying overhead. He sprinted, his legs burning as he zig-zagged through the wreckage of the crash site, keeping low to avoid enemy fire. It was every man for himself now, and he couldn’t afford to think about the others, he had to survive.

As the dust cleared, he glanced around, trying to get a sense of his surroundings. He spotted a small outcropping of rocks to his right, just beyond the smoldering wreckage of another downed VTOL. It was enough of a cover for now, but Rowan knew it wouldn’t be long before the enemy’s attention turned his way.

And then he saw it.

A transport vehicle, emblazoned with the Citadel’s seal, rolled slowly past the battlefield. The convoy was guarded heavily, Elite Honor Guards marching alongside it, keeping a right watch. The vehicle was moving cautiously.

Rowan’s breath caught in his throat. This was it, the chance he needed. This was the link to the Citadel, the heart of everything they were trying to destroy. But this was also dangerous. The transport could lead them right into the heart of enemy territory, or it could be a trap. 

But the Citadel’s secrets were inside that transport, and if Rowan had any chance of completing this mission, it would be now or never.

Without hesitating, he sprinted to the nearest cover and slid down behind a stack of debris, his heart pounding in his chest. The transport was moving closer, unaware of his presence. Rowan’s fingers brushed the trigger of his weapon, but he held off. He had to be patient. Timing was everything.

This was his moment.

He needed to follow the transport and find out where it was going—get inside, get what information he could, and then get out.

This was the turning point.

This was his war.

Rowan’s heart slammed in his chest as the Citadel transport screeched to a halt. The rear doors of the transport opened, and the air seemed to freeze. It was like the world stopped turning as the imposing figure of (text-colour:purple)[Lord Septu] emerged.

He stood tall, like a living monument to destruction. His presence alone sent a chill through Rowan’s veins. Septu was a warlord, feared across every battlefield. He was the High Commander of the United Federation Army. He was the throne, and no one had ever dared to challenge his reign, until now.

Rowan cursed under his breath. He had underestimated the scope of this mission. This wasn’t just about breaking into the Citadel, it was about stopping *him*. 

Septu didn’t walk; he towered. As if he knew that no one would dare approach him without regret. His eyes fell on Rowan.

Rowan felt his stomach drop. He had been caught, exposed. 

Rowan’s breath caught in his throat, and before he could retreat, he knew it was already too late.

“*You...*” Septu’s voice was like the crackling of static, distorted but dripping with contempt. He didn’t even have to speak loudly. His mere presence was enough to command the battlefield, every soldier freezing in place as he spoke. “You think you can take *my* throne?”

Rowan&#39;s pulse quickened, and without thinking, he shouted, “*I messed up!*”

Septu’s lips curled into a cruel smile. “*Indeed, you have.*”

Suddenly, the world shifted. Septu reached back, his hand gripping the cold, metal casing of his cyberspine. It crackled, a fusion reactor within it sparking to life, unstable and glowing with the eerie light of the Void Crystal embedded deep inside. 

The high-pitched whine of the unstable fusion reactor grew louder, a sound like a thousand voices whispering in agony, and Rowan felt a surge of dread rise within him. He had heard stories, whispers about Septu’s cyberspine and the Void Crystal that powered it, but seeing it in action was another thing entirely.

The unstable fusion reactor sent a shockwave through the air, rattling the ground beneath Rowan’s feet. His mind raced, and every instinct screamed for him to run. But the cold, hard reality of the situation hit him like a physical blow.

Septu moved faster than he could see. One second he was standing, the next his towering figure was looking over Rowan. In a single, fluid motion, Septu’s foot shot down, slamming into the ground beside Rowan with the force of a collapsing building. 

Rowan’s body went rigid as the pressure of Septu’s grip pressed down on him. His breath was knocked out of his chest as he was pinned to the earth, the weight of the High Commander’s power suffocating him.

“*You tried, but you will never come close to taking my throne.*” Septu’s voice was a cold, merciless growl. The sheer force of the words felt like an avalanche, crushing him.

Rowan struggled to breathe, every muscle in his body aching as Septu’s crushing grip pushed him harder into the dirt. But even through this, Rowan knew one thing for certain.

Septu was the demigod of war. His cyberspine was the physical manifestation of his domination. He was only one of the rulers of the United Federation, a living, breathing embodiment of power.

But Septu wasn’t finished. His hand pressed down harder, the force intensifying as his glowing cyberspine singing with energy. “You think you can challenge me? You think you can *defeat* me?”

" tags="" position="1550,6850" size="100,100">The night had passed, and as the first light of morning crept into the dim dormitory, Rowan awoke. The dream was still fresh in his mind, as though it had painted a different version of reality, a vision of peace and self-worth that felt impossible to grasp in the harsh world around him. His eyes opened slowly, the weight of the mission ahead pulling him back into the present.
