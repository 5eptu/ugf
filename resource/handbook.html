            <h2>Border Rules</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Professional Conduct</strong><br>
                    All personnel must uphold the highest standards of respect towards both higher and lower-ranking individuals. Lower ranks are to be addressed by their respective titles, while higher-ranking officials shall be referred to as “Sir” or “Ma’am.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use of Firearms</strong><br>
                    Firearms are issued to staff members primarily to ensure public safety. Any personnel engaging in unwarranted violence against civilians for illegitimate reasons will face immediate termination. Additionally, random aiming or discharging of firearms is strictly prohibited and will result in severe disciplinary action.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Communication Standards</strong><br>
                    Maintaining high standards of communication, particularly regarding grammar, is essential. Lower-ranked personnel will receive warnings for lapses in grammar, while higher-ranking members may incur mild disciplinary measures. Clear communication is critical for operational efficiency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Prohibition of Unlawful Conduct</strong><br>
                    Unlawful behavior, including trolling and any form of harassment, is strictly prohibited. Offenders will face severe consequences, potentially leading to dismissal based on the severity of the infraction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Security Measures</strong><br>
                    Unauthorized access to restricted areas will result in detainment. In cases involving civilian trespassers, appropriate measures will be taken, ranging from arrest to the use of force, as dictated by the situation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Correct Addressing</strong><br>
                    Accurate addressing of individuals is paramount. Failure to address someone correctly will result in a warning, reinforcing the importance of maintaining professionalism in all interactions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Conduct During Critical Situations</strong><br>
                    Immature behavior during critical moments is unacceptable. Personnel exhibiting inappropriate or unserious conduct during vital operations will face demotion. Strict adherence to professionalism and seriousness is expected, especially in situations of utmost importance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Insubordination Policy</strong><br>
                    <strong>Definition:</strong> Insubordination encompasses willful disobedience of orders, disrespect towards superior officers, and failure to comply with directives.<br>
                    <strong>Consequences:</strong> Insubordination will be met with escalating disciplinary measures, which may include demotion or dismissal from the Federation, depending on the severity of the offense.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Detain Protocol</strong><br>
                    Misuse of detainment procedures may result in demotion or placement on a detain blacklist. Detainment is authorized only in specific scenarios, such as handling test subjects or during moderation interventions. In all other instances, the use of firearms is the preferred method.
